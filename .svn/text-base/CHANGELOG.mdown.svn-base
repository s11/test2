## 20090629

!!!WOOT!!!! One database to rule them all!

[MAJOR] Readded a migration to completely reorganise the menus, categories, topics & tasksheets etc. Menus displaying properly. Topics still need work.

[MAJOR] Merged a MASSIVE amount of code (from local branch) to remove composite\_primary\_key dependency and have a straight user\_id FK. Goodbye pain in the arse.
        - Migrations to clean up the user table. All column with an empty string have been set to NULL 
        - Migration fo add user\_id columns to those table that previously required the client\_prefix, username columns. The old columns are still accessible for legacy apps.
        - Removed the javascript in favour of relying just on jQuery. Too many unused and unneeded scripts from all over the place

Still to do:

  - Tasksheet management for supervisors & instructors (1 day)
  - Messaging needs to be rewritten (1 - 2 days)
  - Topic display (1 day)
  - Video selection in sidebar (a few hours)

Othe changes...

* Added a singular ClientController resource. Think of it as a place for client configuration. Will primarily be for changing the instance's menu.
* Clean up the routes signifacntly.
* Added a current\_content\_version column to the users table and removed the user\_properties table.
* Fixed a bug where sorted categories where incorrectly scoped against the menu\_version instead of the menu\_version\_id

    query\_trace
··
  - Removed the following superfluous gems:

    libxml-ruby
    giraffesoft-timeline\_fu
    hpricot
    mislav-will\_paginate
    thumblemonks-load\_model

  - Removed the following superfluous plugins:

    acts\_as\_list
    acts\_as\_paranoid
    acts\_as\_versioned
    default\_value\_for
    redhillonrails\_stripper
    yaml\_db

## 20090623

* Disabled ActiveRecord session store. Use cookies instead.

  client\_upgrades.rb
  country.rb
  csv\_file.rb
  net\_suite\_trial\_request.rb
  region.rb
