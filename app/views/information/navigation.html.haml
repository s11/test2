        %p
          %strong
            1. First Click

          &ndash; Now we have four menu columns to choose from: The Main Menu; Topic Area; Topic Group; and Topics.&nbsp; For more detailed information before you select a particular topic, click on any Topic Area title, or Topic Group title &ndash; or click on any Topic listed in the right hand column.

          %strong
            3. Third Click
          &ndash; Clicking on a Topic title brings up an introductory web page like this one.&nbsp; There will usually be at least several other related elements linked to this topic that you can select from this Icon Bar&hellip;
          %br

    %tr
      %td{ :colspan => "2" }
        %p

          &nbsp;
    %tr
      %td{ :colspan => "2" }
