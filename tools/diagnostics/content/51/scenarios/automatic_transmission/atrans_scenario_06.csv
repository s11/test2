Vehicle won't move in any forward or reverse gears(s).,Stripped splines on transmission input shaft.,A,Vehicle has no drive in either forward or reverse.,Check fluid level and condition. ,Fluid level is within required specifications. Condition of fluid appears OK. ,1,Yes,What is the simplest potential cause for this problem?,Perform transmission pressure tests. ,Line pressure normal. All clutch and band hydraulic pressures normal. But no governor pressure.,1,Yes,Is there line pressure?,Replace stripped input shaft.,Well done. You have identified the fault and corrected it. The torque converter turned the front pump so all transmission pressures (except governor) were normal. The stripped input shaft couldn't apply torque to the gear train. ,1,Yes,"If the hydraulic pressures are good in each gear, what can cause a no drive condition?"
,,,,Test drive vehicle for operation under initial movement from a standstill and hill starts.,Vehicle  can not be test driven. It won't move.,2,No,,Check fluid level and condition. ,Fluid level is within required specifications. Condition of fluid appears OK. ,2,No,,Replace pan gasket and refill with proper fluid. ,This action did not rectify the issue.,2,No,
,,,,Test drive vehicle for operation under all driving conditions when cold.,Vehicle  can not be test driven. It won't move.,2,No,,Inspect condition of transmission mounts.,Transmission mounts appear okay.,2,No,,Replace governor valve assembly.,This action did not rectify the issue.,2,No,
,,,,Test drive vehicle to determine any unusual transmission noises. ,Vehicle  can not be test driven. It won't move.,2,No,,Apply air pressure to operate bands and clutches.,Bands and clutches apply normally with no excessive leakage.,2,No,,Rebuild/overhaul valve body assembly.,This action did not rectify the issue.,2,No,
,,,,Test drive vehicle for operation in reverse.,Vehicle  can not be test driven. It won't move.,2,No,,Check transmission cooler system for restriction (flow test).,No restrictions found. ,2,No,,"Flush fluid and replace filter, if equipped. ",This action did not rectify the issue.,2,No,
,,,,Check gear selector linkage for proper adjustment. ,Gear selector linkage appears to be adjusted properly. ,2,No,,"Drop pan, look for plugged filter and debris. ",Filter clean and no apparent debris found. ,2,No,,Replace bands and clutches.,This action did not rectify the issue.,2,No,
,,,,Inspect condition of transmission mounts.,Transmission mounts appear OK.,2,No,,"Drop pan, disassemble and inspect valve body.",Valves and valve body in good condition. ,2,No,,Replace flex plate bolts. ,This action did not rectify the issue.,2,No,
,,,,,,,,,Check gear selector linkage for proper adjustment. ,Gear selector linkage appears to be adjusted properly. ,2,No,,Install high performance transmission cooler.,This action did not rectify the issue.,2,No,
,,,,,,,,,"Perform converter ""stall"" test.",Vehicle  can not be test driven. It won't move.,2,No,,Reseal the transmission,This action did not rectify the issue.,2,No,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Replace front pump assembly.,This action did not rectify the issue.,2,No,
