Vehicle won't move in any forward or reverse gears(s). Transmission overhauled 3 months ago.,Sheared/missing flex plate bolts.,A,No drive in either forward or reverse.,Check fluid level and condition. ,Fluid level is within required specifications. Condition of fluid appears OK. ,1,Yes,What is the simplest potential cause for this problem?,Perform transmission pressure tests. ,No line pressure.,1,Pass,Is there line pressure?,Replace flex plate bolts. ,"Well done. You have identified the fault and corrected it. The last tech forgot to torque the flex plate to converter bolts which backed out and sheared off. This prevented the front pump from being turned, so there was no line pressure. The input shaft turned the gear train but there was no pressure to apply bands and clutches. ",1,Yes,What possibilities can cause no line pressure?
