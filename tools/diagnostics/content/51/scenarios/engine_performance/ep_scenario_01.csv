Engine Misfire (steady misfire).,Fuel Injector stuck closed.,A,MIL Light on.,Scan PCM with scan tool.,"P0304 Code - Cylinder #4 Misfire. Further tests found good compression, good spark to spark plug, and spark plug in good condition. However P0131 02 Sensor Circuit Low Voltage (Bank I Sensor I).",1,Yes,The MIL light indicates the PCM has identified a problem in the systems it monitors. ,Test waveform pattern of fuel injector on labscope.,Waveform shows good #4 Injector open and close signal but injector stuck closed/not opening.,1,Yes,"Since the compression and ignition system appear to be fine, what delivers fuel to that cylinder?",Replace fuel injector(s).,Well done! You have identified the fault and corrected it.,1,Yes,"Since the injector has a good waveform, but is not opening, what needs component needs to be replaced?"
