Engine cranks very slowly or not at all - starting system working properly.,Seized piston(s).,A,Engine oil very low.,"Measure required torque to turn over engine by hand, compare to specs.","With accessory belt and spark plugs removed, engine requires excessive torque to turn it over in either direction. ",1,Yes,Does the engine turns normally with the plugs removed?,Disassemble and Inspect.,Pistons extremely overheated due to lack of lubrication and partially seized in cylinder block which is heavily scored. ,1,Yes,How do you determine what is making it difficult to rotate?,Overhaul/replace engine.,"Yes, this is the only reasonable action.",1,Yes,You have disassembled the engine and made an inspection of the components. Now what is the best solution?
