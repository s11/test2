::TQ0090::What happens to the properties of steel when the amount of carbon is varied? {
	=Properties such as ductility, hardness and toughness are changed.#Different properties mean steel can be designed for different uses. For instance, low-carbon steels generally have more toughness - more resistance to fracture - whereas high-carbon steel is usually harder but more brittle.

::TQ0093::How is the induction hardening process carried out?{
	=Induction hardening is done by inducing a high current flow into the component that needs hardening.#After the induction current flow has sufficiently heated the steel, the material is usually quenched in oil. A flame hardening process uses water quenching.
	~Induction hardening is done by inducing a low current flow into the component that needs hardening.#After the induction current flow has sufficiently heated the steel, the material is usually quenched in oil. A flame hardening process uses water quenching.
	~Induction hardening is done by inducing a high voltage flow into the component that needs hardening.#After the induction current flow has sufficiently heated the steel, the material is usually quenched in oil. A flame hardening process uses water quenching.

::TQ0094::How is flame hardening different to induction hardening?{
	=They both work in a similar fashion but in flame hardening, the material is water-quenched.#Rapid quenching of steel can make it harder but can also make it more brittle.  Flame hardening process uses water quenching, induction hardening usually uses oil-quenching.
	~They both work in a similar fashion but in flame hardening, the material is not quenched at all.#Rapid quenching of steel can make it harder but can also make it more brittle.  Flame hardening process uses water quenching, induction hardening usually uses oil-quenching.
	~They both work in a similar fashion but in flame hardening, the material is dry salt quenched.#Rapid quenching of steel can make it harder but can also make it more brittle.  Flame hardening process uses water quenching, induction hardening usually uses oil-quenching.
	~They both work in a similar fashion but in flame hardening, the material is immersed in an alkaline solution.#Rapid quenching of steel can make it harder but can also make it more brittle.  Flame hardening process uses water quenching, induction hardening usually uses oil-quenching.
