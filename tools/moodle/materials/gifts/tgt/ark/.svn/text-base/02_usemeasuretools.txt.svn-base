::TQ0174::If the feeler gauge you are using is too thick you should:{
	=use smaller gauges until one fits snugly.#Feeler gauges determine distance between two components. There should be a snug fit to determine that accurate clearance exists.
	~lubricate the gauge and try again.#Feeler gauges determine distance between two components. There should be a snug fit to determine that accurate clearance exists.
	~use a smaller gauge that slides easily under the part.#Feeler gauges determine distance between two components. There should be a snug fit to determine that accurate clearance exists.
	~measure a different section of the component.#Feeler gauges determine distance between two components. There should be a snug fit to determine that accurate clearance exists.

::TQ0179::Why should you always hold a micrometer by the insulating block on the frame?{
	=Because heat from your hand will cause the frame to expand and give an inaccurate reading.#It is important that other factors do not affect a micrometer measurement. For example, if a micrometer is held in your hand, the heat from your fingers can cause the frame to expand and give an inaccurate reading. Always hold the micrometer by the insulating block on the frame. This will prevent the heat from your fingers reaching the micrometer.

For example, if a micrometer is held in your hand, the heat from your fingers can cause the frame to expand and give an inaccurate reading. Always hold the micrometer by the insulating block on the frame. This will prevent the heat from your fingers reaching the micrometer.

::TQ0180::What are the most popular types of tire pressure gauges?{
	=Pencil type and dial type.#The two most popular types of pocket tire pressure gauges are the pencil type and the dial type. The pencil type looks similar to a pencil and contains a graduated sliding extension that is forced out of the sleeve by air pressure when it is attached to the tire valve. The dial type has a similar fitting to the pencil type but includes a graduated gauge and needle.
