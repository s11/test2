::TQ1413::Both intake and exhaust valves are closed during the compression and power strokes.{
	=TRUE#The intake valve is only open during the intake stroke, and the exhaust valve is only open during the exhaust stroke.
	~FALSE#The intake valve is only open during the intake stroke, and the exhaust valve is only open during the exhaust stroke.

::TQ1414::In one 4-stroke cycle, how many strokes produce energy to turn the crankshaft?{
	=One stroke.#In a 4-stroke gasoline engine, the crankshaft does two revolutions in each engine cycle. Only one of its 4-strokes delivers energy to the crankshaft.
	~Two strokes.#In a 4-stroke gasoline engine, the crankshaft does two revolutions in each engine cycle. Only one of its 4-strokes delivers energy to the crankshaft.
	~Four strokes.#In a 4-stroke gasoline engine, the crankshaft does two revolutions in each engine cycle. Only one of its 4-strokes delivers energy to the crankshaft.
	~Three strokes.#In a 4-stroke gasoline engine, the crankshaft does two revolutions in each engine cycle. Only one of its 4-strokes delivers energy to the crankshaft.

::TQ1415::A spark plug ignites the air-fuel mixture. This is called:{
	=combustion.#The piston compresses the air-fuel mixture into a smaller volume before the spark plug ignites it.
	~compression.#The piston compressions the air-ful mixture into a smaller volum before the spark plug ignites it.
	~power.#The piston compressions the air-ful mixture into a smaller volum before the spark plug ignites it.
	~intake.#The piston compressions the air-ful mixture into a smaller volum before the spark plug ignites it.

::TQ1416::The reciprocating action of the piston turns into the _______ motion of the crankshaft.{
	=rotary#The whole process is a cycle. A new mixture enters and is ignited. Combustion occurs, expanding gases drive the piston down and turn the crankshaft which pushes the piston back up the cylinder.
	~oscillating#The whole process is a cycle. A new mixture enters and is ignited. Combustion occurs, expanding gases drive the piston down and turn the crankshaft which pushes the piston back up the cylinder.
	~repetitive#The whole process is a cycle. A new mixture enters and is ignited. Combustion occurs, expanding gases drive the piston down and turn the crankshaft which pushes the piston back up the cylinder.
	~elliptical#The whole process is a cycle. A new mixture enters and is ignited. Combustion occurs, expanding gases drive the piston down and turn the crankshaft which pushes the piston back up the cylinder.
