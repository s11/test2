::TQ1440::In a conventional 4-stroke cycle internal combustion engine, the compression stroke and the power, or expansion stroke, are often referred to as symmetrical. This limits the engine's efficiency and engines with modified cycles are now being used in cars. How is this achieved?{
	=The Miller Cycle and the Atkinson Cycle overcome this by using valve timing variations to make the effective compression and expansion strokes asymmetrical. This means that the effective stroke of the engine can be changed by valve overlap variations.#In the Miller cycle the intake valve is left open longer than it normally would be. This is the 'fifth' cycle that the Miller cycle introduces. As the piston moves back up in what is normally the compression stroke, the charge is being pushed back out the normally closed valve. The Atkinson cycle may also refer to a four stroke engine in which the intake valve is held open longer than normal to allow a reverse flow into the intake manifold.

::TQ1444::Miller and Atkinson engines are said to operate more efficiently. Do they have a disadvantage? {
	=They produce a lower power output for a given engine capacity. #The narrow range of speeds over which these engines are efficient make them less useful as a primary power source, but ideal in applications such as a series-parallel hybrid vehicle, charging and working in tandem with a battery-driven electric motor.
