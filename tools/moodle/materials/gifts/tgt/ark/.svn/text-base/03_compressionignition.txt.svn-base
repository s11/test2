::TQ1455::In a two-stroke diesel engine the process of moving the exhaust gases out and the new air into the cylinder is called scavenging. {
	=TRUE#The piston uncovers the inlet ports and the blower delivers fresh air into the cylinder. Incoming air scavenges exhaust gases out of the cylinder. Without effective scavenging, diesel engines lose efficiency.
	~FALSE#The piston uncovers the inlet ports and the blower delivers fresh air into the cylinder. Incoming air scavenges exhaust gases out of the cylinder. Without effective scavenging, diesel engines lose efficiency.

::TQ1457::What is the main difference between the intake strokes of a 4-stroke gasoline and a 4-stroke diesel engine?{
	=Unlike the gasoline engine, only air enters the cylinder on the intake stroke of a diesel engine.#At the end of the compression stroke of a diesel engine, an injector sprays fuel into the combustion chamber. It mixes with the very hot compressed air and ignites.

::TQ1460::Why are diesel engines also known as compression ignition engines?{
	=The heat produced by compresssing the air ignites the fuel.#Diesel engine components are exposed to higher operating temperatures, pressures, and forces than gasoline engines of similar size. Because their compression ratios are higher, there is no need for an ignition system as in a gasoline engine, and their engine parts are usually heavier or more rugged than those of similar output gasoline engines. 
	~Ignition occurs at the beginning of the compression stroke.#Diesel engine components are exposed to higher operating temperatures, pressures, and forces than gasoline engines of similar size. Because their compression ratios are higher, there is no need for an ignition system as in a gasoline engine, and their engine parts are usually heavier or more rugged than those of similar output gasoline engines.
