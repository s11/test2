::TQ1489::What is the main design feature of the hemispherical combustion chamber?{
	=The intake and exhaust valves are on opposite sides of the combustion chamber.#A hemispherical, or pent-roof combustion chamber has the intake valve on one side of the chamber and the exhaust valve on the other. This provides crossflow. Air-fuel mixture enters on one side, and exhaust gases exit on the other. Positioning the valves in this way leaves room for relatively large valves and ports, and that helps the engine breathe. Breathing refers to the engine taking in the air or air-fuel mixture.
	~Only overhead camshafts can be used.#A hemispherical, or pent-roof combustion chamber has the intake valve on one side of the chamber and the exhaust valve on the other. This provides crossflow. Air-fuel mixture enters on one side, and exhaust gases exit on the other. Positioning the valves in this way leaves room for relatively large valves and ports, and that helps the engine breathe. Breathing refers to the engine taking in the air or air-fuel mixture.
	~The valves are side by side and in line.#A hemispherical, or pent-roof combustion chamber has the intake valve on one side of the chamber and the exhaust valve on the other.

::TQ1491::The main reason for fitting a gasket between two surfaces is to:{
	=form a seal between two mating parts.#Gaskets form a seal by being compressed between stationary parts where liquid or gas could pass. Most gaskets are made to be used only once.

::TQ1493::When all of the intake ports are on one side and all the exhaust ports are on the other, it is called a:{
	=cross-flow head.#Smaller intake and exhaust passages and ports allow more torque at low engine speeds. At high speeds, smaller passages restrict airflow. Larger passages produce greater power at high engine speeds.
	~counter-flow head.#Smaller intake and exhaust passages and ports allow more torque at low engine speeds. At high speeds, smaller passages restrict airflow. Larger passages produce greater power at high engine speeds.

::TQ1494::Some modern high temperature head gaskets are called 'anisotropic' in nature.  What does that mean?{
	=The gasket is designed to conduct heat laterally to transfer heat from the engine to the coolant faster.#Anisotropic gaskets are normally constructed with a steel core. Special facing materials are added to both sides of the gasket core to provide a comprehensive seal under varying torque conditions.
	~The side layers of the gasket are designed to withstand temperatures up to 2100 degrees F or 1150 degrees C.#Anisotropic gaskets are normally constructed with a steel core. Special facing materials are added to both sides of the gasket core to provide a comprehensive seal under varying torque conditions.
	~An added silicone based outer coating on both sides of the side material layers provides additional cold sealing ability during start-up and warm-up.#Anisotropic gaskets are normally constructed with a steel core. Special facing materials are added to both sides of the gasket core to provide a comprehensive seal under varying torque conditions.
	~When oil  penetrates the edge of the gasket material, it is designed to swell by approximately 30% to increase sealing pressure.#Anisotropic gaskets are normally constructed with a steel core. Special facing materials are added to both sides of the gasket core to provide a comprehensive seal under varying torque conditions.
