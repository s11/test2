::TQ1568::Technicians are commencing the rebuilding of an engine that has undergone extensive machining and parts replacement. Technician A says that before the actual re-assembly commences technicians should perform temporary test buildup to ensure that all the parts fit. Technician B says that before the actual re-assembly commences technicians should perform temporary test buildup to ensure that no additional machining is required.{
	~Technician A.#Both technicians are correct. It is very important to perform a temporary test build up of the rotating assembly. You should also install the camshaft, cylinder heads and the valve train for one cylinder. Do not skip this section of the rebuild; it will determine if additional machining or exchange of any parts will be necessary. All components should be either refurbished, new, or thoroughly cleaned. The decks, cylinders and main bores of the block should all be refurbished.

::TQ1569::The most important thing to check before inserting the camshaft back into the engine is the ensure that:{
	=the oil holes in the bearing shell line up with the oil passages.#Make sure that all the oil holes in the bearings line up with the oil feed holes in the block. All you need is something like a paper clip to check that. If any of the bearings don't line up with the oil holes, you will need to pull them out and reposition them.

::TQ1570::When installing the crankshaft, which of the following processes is correct?{
	=1.Don't hammer on the bearings you should be able to press them all in by hand. 2.Ensure the bearings are fitted correctly with oil feed holes in the block and bearings line up. 3.Ensure the bearings and crankshaft have a light smear of oil over them before installing the crankshaft. 4. Install thrust bearings. 5.Carefully lower crankshaft into position. #Don't hammer on the bearings you should be able to press them all in by hand, Put a drop of oil on each bearing and wipe it very thin and evenly. It is not a good idea to lay a crankshaft on totally dry bearings.Every engine has one main journal that will have a thrust bearing installed in it. This bearing is the one that will limit the forward or backward movement of the crankshaft in the block. Make sure to wipe some oil on the thrust surface of the thrust bearing as well. The crankshaft will be rubbing on the thrust face of the bearing at these two points.  Ask for some lifting help if you need it, and then gently set the crank into the block. 
	~1. When installing the main bearings, lightly tap with hammer on the bearings ends a good fit and a good contact between the bearing shell and block. 2.

	=check the piston to valve clearance to avoid potential damage.#If the camshaft has been changed in the rebuild, it is essential to perform a piston to valve clearance check.
