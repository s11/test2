::TQ1407::The pressure and temperature of a gas are linked. Which of the following is true?{
	=As pressure goes up, temperature goes up.#Temperature is a measure of the average energy of the particles (atoms or molecules) of a substance. This energy occurs as the translational motion of a particle or as internal energy of a particle, such as a molecular vibration or the excitation of an electron energy level. When gas pressure increases so will the temperature of the gas.

::TQ1408::As a plunger is pushed in, the air inside a cylinder is forced into a smaller volume. What is the effect on the pressure inside the cylinder?{
	=An increase in pressure.#As a cylinder volume decreases, the contents are squeezed into a smaller space creating increased pressure.
	~A decrease in pressure.#As a cylinder volume decreases, the contents are squeezed into a smaller space creating increased pressure.
	~The pressure remains the same.#As a cylinder volume decreases, the contents are squeezed into a smaller space creating increased pressure.

::TQ1409::The temperature of a gas is a measure of how much energy it has. The more energy it has, the more work it can do.{
	=TRUE#Temperature is a physical property of a system that underlies the common notions of hot and cold; something that is hotter has the greater temperature. Temperature is one of the principal parameters of thermodynamics. The temperature of a system is related to the average energy of microscopic motions in the system.
	~FALSE#Temperature is a physical property of a system that underlies the common notions of hot and cold; something that is hotter has the greater temperature. Temperature is one of the principal parameters of thermodynamics. The temperature of a system is related to the average energy of microscopic motions in the system.
