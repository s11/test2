::TQ1427::What type of scavenging has the inlet or transfer ports within 90 degrees of the exhaust ports?{
	=Loop scavenging.#The position of the ports is important for how mixture enters the cylinder, and for how burned gases leave it. Removing exhaust gases is called scavenging.
	~Crossflow scavenging.#The position of the ports is important for how mixture enters the cylinder, and for how burned gases leave it. Removing exhaust gases is called scavenging.

::TQ1431::Why do 2-stroke pistons not have an oil control ring?{
	=Because lubricating oil is mixed with the fuel, so it is not required.#The top two piston rings are called compression rings. A third ring scrapes excess oil off the cylinder walls. Since 2-stroke petrol engines are usually lubricated by oil mixed with the petrol, they don't need this oil control ring.
