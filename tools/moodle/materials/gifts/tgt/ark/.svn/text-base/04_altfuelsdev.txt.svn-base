	=a series hybrid vehicle arrangement#In a series hybrid vehicle arrangement, the diesel engine is not directly linked to the transmission to drive the wheels. It is used to drive a generator/alternator to provide power to recharge the energy storage devices, usually batteries whereas in a parallel hybrid vehicle arrangement the diesel engine and the electric motor both have direct and independent connection the vehicle transmission. Drive can be provided independently or as a combination to turn the vehicle wheels.
