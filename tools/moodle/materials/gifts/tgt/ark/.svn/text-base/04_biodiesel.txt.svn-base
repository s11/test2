::TQ0111::Biodiesel is said to have advantages when used, it can also cause disadvantages. Which of the following can be an effect of using biodiesel? {
	=all of these#Biodiesel is a better solvent than petro-diesel, so it helps to clean the fuel system as it flows through it, and it can break down and flush out residue deposits in vehicles that have been running on petro-diesel. It is important to clean the lines before changing over to biodiesel fuel, or the solvent action of the fuel will quickly clog up fuel filters. The used of biodiesel also substantially improves the fuel's lubricity.

::TQ0112::What does the term B20 mean?{
	=that the fuel contains 20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent petroleum diesel.#Commercial blends of biodiesel and petroleum diesel are designated with the letter 'B,' followed by the volumetric percentage of biodiesel in the blend: B20, the blend most commonly available, contains 20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent petroleum diesel. B100 is pure biodiesel.
