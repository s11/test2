::TQ0406::As result of combustion of the fuel and the air in an uncontrolled engine, what would be the approximate % of emissions that would come from the exhaust?{
	=0.6#The term 'emission' normally refers to the pollution produced by a vehicle during normal use. Emission control systems are designed to limit the pollution caused by the harmful products of storing and burning fuel.

::TQ0407::What happens to the air/fuel mixture if a manifold is too cold?{
	=It creates a lean mixture.#A lean mixture may cause incomplete combustion. Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions are highest from a cold engine.

::TQ0408::What does the term 'quenching' mean in relation to the burning of fuel in an engine?{
	=A poor design can allow the flame front of the burning fuel to be quenched. This results in incomplete combustion of the air/fuel mixture and as a result hydrocarbons can be emitted into the atmosphere. This is not desirable.#Quenching refers to putting out a fire: to extinguish.  Therefore a quenching condition refers to the combustion flame front unable to sustain the burn.  The net result is high CO and HC emission.
