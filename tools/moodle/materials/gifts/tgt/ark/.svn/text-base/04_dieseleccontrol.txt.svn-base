::TQ0369::Electronic controls have delivered other benefits besides a reduction in fuel consumption and emissions. What do these include?{
	=Increased power and torque, and improved engine responsiveness.#Fuel Injection is a method or system for metering fuel into an internal combustion engine. The fuel is then burned in air to produce heat, which in turn is converted to mechanical work by the engine. In modern applications, fuel injection is typically only one of several important tasks performed by electronic controls for the fuel system.
