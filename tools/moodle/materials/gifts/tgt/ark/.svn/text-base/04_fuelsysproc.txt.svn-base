::TQ0338::In a vehicle with an electric fuel pump, how is static pressure removed?{
	=Remove the fuel pump fuse and run the engine until it stops as it runs out of fuel. Turn ignition off.#Never allow petrol fuel under pressure to spray into the atmosphere. Petrol vapours are extremely dangerous and volatile. This can cause fire and explosion leading to serious injury.
	~Drain the fuel tank until there is no fuel left.#Never allow petrol fuel under pressure to spray into the atmosphere. Petrol vapours are extremely dangerous and volatile. This can cause fire and explosion leading to serious injury.
	~Clamp the fuel pipes.#Never allow petrol fuel under pressure to spray into the atmosphere. Petrol vapours are extremely dangerous and volatile. This can cause fire and explosion leading to serious injury.
	~Loosen the fuel pipes to allow pressurised fuel to escape and wait for pressure to drop.#Never allow petrol fuel under pressure to spray into the atmosphere. Petrol vapours are extremely dangerous and volatile. This can cause fire and explosion leading to serious injury.
