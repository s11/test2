::TQ0562::A rear suspension U-bolt:{
	=clamps the leaf spring to the axle housing.#Leaf springs consist of one or more flat springs made of tempered steel. A number of leaves of different length are used to form a multi-leaf spring. They are held together by a center bolt that passes through a hole in the center of each leaf. It is also used to locate the axle on the spring. The axle is then clamped to the spring by U-bolts that wrap around the axle housing and through a spring plate underneath the spring.
