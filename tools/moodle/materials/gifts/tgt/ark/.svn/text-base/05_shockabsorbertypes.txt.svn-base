::TQ0544::A standard hydraulic shock absorber is designed to:{
	=dampen spring oscillations.#The most widely used hydraulic shock absorber is the direct-acting telescopic type. It can be fitted as a self-contained unit, or combined with a suspension strut. The strut type uses the same principle of operation but it is considerably larger.  The hydraulic shock absorber provides its dampening action by transferring oil under pressure through valves which restrict the oil flow.

::TQ0545::Shock absorbers convert the energy they absorb into:{
	=heat.#The rapid movement of the piston continually forcing the oil backwards and forwards through the valves causes it to heat up as it absorbs the energy of motion of the spring and converts it into heat. The heat is transferred through the outer tube to the outside air. However, the hotter the oil becomes the greater its tendency to aerate. Aeration occurs because of the high velocity of the oil as it passes through the small passages in the valves. If the velocity is high enough, air dissolved in the oil, comes out of solution as small bubbles, and forms a foam.
