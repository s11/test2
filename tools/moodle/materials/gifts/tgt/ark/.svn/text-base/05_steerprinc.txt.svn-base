	=FALSE#4-wheel steering (or all wheel steering) is a system employed by some vehicles to increase vehicle stability while maneuvering at high speed, or to decrease turning radius at low speed. In most 4-wheel steering systems the rear wheels are steered by a computer and actuators. The rear wheels generally cannot turn as far as the front wheels.
