::TQ0573::Technician A says that if a shock absorber is being replaced because of wear or damage, the shock absorber on the opposite side only needs to be replaced if it is also worn or damaged. Technician B says that if a strut is being replaced because of wear or damage, the strut on the opposite side should also be replaced. Who is correct?{
	~Technician A.#Technician B is correct because suspension components should always be changed as a pair or vehicle handling stability could be affected in operation.

::TQ0574::Technician A says that shock absorbers sometimes leak when they are worn out. Technician B says that shock absorbers can be worn out but may not leak. Who is correct?{
	~Technician A.#Both technicians are correct as shock absorbers that leak are obviously damaged. However shocks may be ineffective at dampening oscillations but not exhibits signs of leakage.
