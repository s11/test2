::TQ0520::Independent suspension:{

::TQ0521::Some manufacturers set the lower wishbone pivots points wide apart on front suspension layouts. The reason for this is:{
	=as the front wheels do the most of the braking, they sustain the majority of the braking forces.#The control arms have flexible bushes at each connecting point to allow for suspension movement. The driving thrust and braking torque are transferred through the control arms and bushes to the frame. When a vehicle is in motion several forces operate to displace the wheel units: driving thrust, braking torque, and cornering force. These forces must be transferred to the frame of the vehicle, but while they act the wheel units must stay aligned with each other and with the frame.
