::TQ0619::Can a wheel alignment be performed only on the front wheels on vehicles fitted with Independent Rear Suspension (IRS)?{
	=Yes. However on a vehicle with Independent Rear Suspension (IRS), undertaking a front-wheel only alignment is considered to be an inadequate procedure.#There are two main types of 4-wheel alignments. In each case, the technician will place an instrument on all four wheels. In the first type, the rear toe and tracking is checked, but all adjustments are made at the front wheels. This is done on vehicles that do not have adjustments on the rear. The second type is a full 4-wheel alignment where the adjustments are first made to true up the rear alignment, then the front is adjusted. A full 4-wheel alignment will cost more than the other type because there is more work involved.
