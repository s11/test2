::TQ0625::Under what circumstance would you fully deflate a tire?{
	=Prior to removing it from the road wheel.#One MUST fully deflate a tire before attempting to remove it from the wheel.
	~When checking the treads.#One MUST fully deflate a tire before attempting to remove it from the wheel.
	~When checking the sidewall for flexibility.#One MUST fully deflate a tire before attempting to remove it from the wheel.

::TQ0626::When checking tire pressures you must make sure that the gauge is accurate. If the gauge is reading high it could lead to the tire being:{
	=under-inflated.#Since both too little and too much inflation pressure sacrifices some of the tire's performance, maintaining the 'right' inflation pressure is very important. Therefore you should ensure the tire inflation gauge being used is accurate.
	~over-inflated.#Since both too little and too much inflation pressure sacrifices some of the tire's performance, maintaining the 'right' inflation pressure is very important. Therefore you should ensure the tire inflation gauge being used is accurate.

::TQ0627::Excessive wear in the middle of a tire tread could indicate:{
	=over-inflation.#Over-inflation has resulted in the central tread area being forced into contact with the road causing rapid or crown wear.
	~under-inflation.#Over-inflation has resulted in the central tread area being forced into contact with the road causing rapid or crown wear.
