::TQ0654::Heavy goods carrying vehicles require extra braking in situations where friction brakes tend to absorb greater heat. Some manufacturers have overcome this situation by:{
	=fitting an exhaust brake.#The exhaust brake is operated by using a 'flap' in the exhaust system which restricts the flow of exhaust gases from the engine. This causes exhaust backpressure to build up on top of the pistons and slows the speed of the engine. Because the engine is directly coupled to the rear wheels through the transmission, braking or retardation of the vehicle occurs.
