::TQ0741::On some master cylinder reservoirs there are two fluid level marks. These indicate:{
	=the minimum and maximum brake fluid levels.#For the brake system to function correctly, the fluid level cannot be too high or too low. Either situation can be detrimental to effective brake operation.
	~the lower mark indicates the minimum fluid level for the brake fluid.#For the brake system to function correctly, the fluid level cannot be too high or too low. Either situation can be detrimental to effective brake operation.
	~the lower mark indicates the maximum fluid level for hot brake fluid.#For the brake system to function correctly, the fluid level cannot be too high or too low. Either situation can be detrimental to effective brake operation.

::TQ0743::Unless otherwise specified by the manufacturer, when should drum brake linings be checked?{
	=Approximately every 15,000 kilometers or 10,000 miles.#Consult the shop manual for the allowable minimum lining thickness.  If the brake shoe linings are covered in oil or grease they must be replaced. Any large score marks mean that the drum will also have to be machined or replaced.
	~Whenever the vehicle has a major service.#Consult the shop manual for the allowable minimum lining thickness.  If the brake shoe linings are covered in oil or grease they must be replaced. Any large score marks mean that the drum will also have to be machined or replaced.
	~Approximately every 25,000 kilometers or 15,000 miles.#Consult the shop manual for the allowable minimum lining thickness.  If the brake shoe linings are covered in oil or grease they must be replaced. Any large score marks mean that the drum will also have to be machined or replaced.
	~Approximately every 40,000 kilometers or 25,000 miles.#Consult the shop manual for the allowable minimum lining thickness.  If the brake shoe linings are covered in oil or grease they must be replaced. Any large score marks mean that the drum will also have to be machined or replaced.

::TQ0745::What must you do before you retract the caliper piston back into its housing?{
	=Check to see if there is sufficient fluid space in the master cylinder reservoir. If not, remove some brake fluid from the reservoir .#Using a siphon, remove enough fluid to cause the reservoir level to drop well below the fill mark. This allows the fluid in the lines to return to the reservoir without overflowing when you retract the caliper pistons for the new pads.
	~Make sure that the handbrake is on.#Using a siphon, remove enough fluid to cause the reservoir level to drop well below the fill mark. This allows the fluid in the lines to return to the reservoir without overflowing when you retract the caliper pistons for the new pads.
	~Perform a runout test on the disc rotors.#Using a siphon, remove enough fluid to cause the reservoir level to drop well below the fill mark. This allows the fluid in the lines to return to the reservoir without overflowing when you retract the caliper pistons for the new pads.
	~Make sure the new pads are exactly the same as the ones being replaced.#Using a siphon, remove enough fluid to cause the reservoir level to drop well below the fill mark. This allows the fluid in the lines to return to the reservoir without overflowing when you retract the caliper pistons for the new pads.
