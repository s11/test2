::TQ0794::The oil level in a manual transmission without a dipstick is correct when:{
	=fluid leaks slowly from the filler plug opening.#Oil level is verified by filling the transmission until oil begins to flow from the fill plug opening.
	~the oil flows freely from the filler plug opening.#Oil level is verified by filling the transmission until oil begins to flow from the fill plug opening.

::TQ0795::When replacing the filler plug it should be tightened:{
	=to manufacturer's specifications.#Most fasteners and vehicle components have torque specifications to avoid damage to the component. Observe torque recommendations.

::TQ0796::What will be the adverse effect of a transmission oil level that is too high?{
	=The fluid will churn and aerate.#The fluid will churn and aerate and form air bubbles that can trap heat and allow the fluid to run hotter. This can lead to early failure of bearings or gears.
	~There will be no adverse effect.#The fluid will churn and aerate and form air bubbles that can trap heat and allow the fluid to run hotter. This can lead to early failure of bearings or gears.
	~There will be improved lubrication.#The fluid will churn and aerate and form air bubbles that can trap heat and allow the fluid to run hotter. This can lead to early failure of bearings or gears.
	~The oil seals will last longer.#The fluid will churn and aerate and form air bubbles that can trap heat and allow the fluid to run hotter. This can lead to early failure of bearings or gears.
