::TQ0864::The governor pressure acts on the end of the transmission 1-2 shift valve and as road speed increases it can become high enough to overcome the opposing forces of spring and throttle pressure.{
	=TRUE#When vehicle speed is low, governor pressure is low.  When vehicle speed is high, governor pressure is high. That pressure is directed to the end of the shift valve, which produces upshifts relative to vehicle speed.
	~FALSE#When vehicle speed is low, governor pressure is low.  When vehicle speed is high, governor pressure is high. That pressure is directed to the end of the shift valve, which produces upshifts relative to vehicle speed.

::TQ0865::Under what conditions does the transmission 'kick-down' function operate?{
	=Kick-down pressure is supplied to the spring end of the 1-2 shift valve to force a 2-1 downshift under 'kick-down' conditions.#Most automatic transmissions have a switch that forces the transmission to downshift into the next lower ratio if the throttle is fully engaged, but this is controlled to prevent a downshift that would over-rev the engine.
	~Kick-down pressure is supplied to the spring end of the 2-3 shift valve to force a 2-3 downshift under 'kick-down' conditions.#Most automatic transmissions have a switch that forces the transmission to downshift into the next lower ratio if the throttle is fully engaged, but this is controlled to prevent a downshift that would over-rev the engine.
	~Kick-down only operates under light load conditions.#Most automatic transmissions have a switch that forces the transmission to downshift into the next lower ratio if the throttle is fully engaged, but this is controlled to prevent a downshift that would over-rev the engine.
	~New transmissions do not have a 'kick-down' function fitted.#Most automatic transmissions have a switch that forces the transmission to downshift into the next lower ratio if the throttle is fully engaged, but this is controlled to prevent a downshift that would over-rev the engine.

::TQ0866::The modulator valve in an automatic transmission assembly consists of a modulator valve and a modulator plug and spring.{
	=TRUE#The modulator valve is operated by throttle pressure but is also subjected to governor pressure, so that its output is sensitive both to accelerator position and to vehicle speed.
	~FALSE#The modulator valve is operated by throttle pressure but is also subjected to governor pressure, so that its output is sensitive both to accelerator position and to vehicle speed.
