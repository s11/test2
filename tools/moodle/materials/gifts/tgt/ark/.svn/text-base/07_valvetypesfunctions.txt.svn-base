::TQ0860::The secondary regulating valve determines the pressure in the converter and in the _______ circuits.{
	=lubricating#The manual valve directs line pressure to the shift valves and to the governor valve.
	~primary#The manual valve directs line pressure to the shift valves and to the governor valve.
	~secondary#The manual valve directs line pressure to the shift valves and to the governor valve.
	~regulating#The manual valve directs line pressure to the shift valves and to the governor valve.

::TQ0861::The primary regulator valve increases line pressure when it is subjected to an increase in:{
	=throttle pressure.#The primary regulating valve maintains line pressure in the system. Line pressure is directed to the manual valve and to the throttle valve at all times.
	~governor pressure.#The primary regulating valve maintains line pressure in the system. Line pressure is directed to the manual valve and to the throttle valve at all times.
	~modulator pressure.#The primary regulating valve maintains line pressure in the system. Line pressure is directed to the manual valve and to the throttle valve at all times.
	~detent pressure.#The primary regulating valve maintains line pressure in the system. Line pressure is directed to the manual valve and to the throttle valve at all times.

::TQ0862::What is the highest pressure in the transmission?{
	=Line pressure.#Line pressure is the highest pressure in the transmission and all other pressures are derived from line pressure.
	~Transmission pressure.#Line pressure is the highest pressure in the transmission and all other pressures are derived from line pressure.
	~Regulator pressure.#Line pressure is the highest pressure in the transmission and all other pressures are derived from line pressure.
	~Control pressure.#Line pressure is the highest pressure in the transmission and all other pressures are derived from line pressure.

::TQ0863::The force required to move the shift valve during up shifts is generated by:{
	=governor pressure.#The shift valves are control valves supplied with line pressure which is varied by the governor valve depending on road speed. Low speed equals low pressure; high speed equals high pressure.
	~spring pressure.#The shift valves are control valves supplied with line pressure which is varied by the governor valve depending on road speed. Low speed equals low pressure; high speed equals high pressure.
	~throttle pressure.#The shift valves are control valves supplied with line pressure which is varied by the governor valve depending on road speed. Low speed equals low pressure; high speed equals high pressure.
	~modulator pressure.#The shift valves are control valves supplied with line pressure which is varied by the governor valve depending on road speed. Low speed equals low pressure; high speed equals high pressure.
