::TQ1155::A 24V 21W bulb consumes more power than a 12 V 21W bulb.{
	=FALSE#21 watt refers to the rate at which the bulb does work. Bulbs are designed to use energy as defined by their rated wattage at a certain voltage. Both bulbs are doing the same amount of work.
	~TRUE#21 watt refers to the rate at which the bulb does work. Bulbs are designed to use energy as defined by their rated wattage at a certain voltage. Both bulbs are doing the same amount of work.

::TQ1156::What type of electronic device is an LED?{
	=An LED is like a normal 'forward biased' diode and only passes current flow in one direction.#The LED lights up only when it is connected in forward bias mode.
	~An LED is like a normal 'reverse biased' diode and only passes current flow in one direction.#The LED lights up only when it is connected in forward bias mode.
	~An LED is like a normal 'forward biased' diode and passes current flow in either direction.#The LED lights up only when it is connected in forward bias mode.
