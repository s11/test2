::TQ1145::What MUST be done when jump starting a vehicle fitted with electronic control units?{
	=On the vehicle being started, turn ALL systems off before connecting the slave battery.#Devices are available to stop any sparks or electrical surges damaging vehicle electronics. They are usually fitted in parallel to the terminals of the battery being jump started. Sometimes the device is fitted into the jumper leads.
	~Turn the headlights on before connecting the slave battery.#Devices are available to stop any sparks or electrical surges damaging vehicle electronics. They are usually fitted in parallel to the terminals of the battery being jump started. Sometimes the device is fitted into the jumper leads.

::TQ1146::Which of the following is the most correct when connecting booster leads to start a vehicle with a discharged battery?{
	=Positive to positive, and negative to engine block.#Because the starter motor is bolted to the engine block, connecting the negative booster lead to the engine block provides a better circuit.
	~Positive to positive, and negative to engine valve cover.#Because the starter motor is bolted to the engine block, connecting the negative booster lead to the engine block provides a better circuit.
	~Positive to positive, and negative to engine intake manifold.#Because the starter motor is bolted to the engine block, connecting the negative booster lead to the engine block provides a better circuit.
	~Positive to positive, and negative to negative.#Because the starter motor is bolted to the engine block, connecting the negative booster lead to the engine block provides a better circuit.

::TQ1150::When undertaking a cranking engine test what voltage should be available in the system to ensure that it is in good condition? {
	=Above 10.25 volts.#If the reading remains above 10.25 Volts then the system is in good condition. If the reading is below 10.25 Volts then this may indicate a fault with the starting system and further investigation is required.
	~Below 9.6 volts.# If the reading remains above 10.25 Volts then the system is in good condition. If the reading is below 10.25 Volts then this may indicate a fault with the starting system and further investigation is required.
	~Between 10.25 and 9.6 volts.# If the reading remains above 10.25 Volts then the system is in good condition. If the reading is below 10.25 Volts then this may indicate a fault with the starting system and further investigation is required.
	~Above 11.8 volts.# If the reading remains above 10.25 Volts then the system is in good condition. If the reading is below 10.25 Volts then this may indicate a fault with the starting system and further investigation is required.
