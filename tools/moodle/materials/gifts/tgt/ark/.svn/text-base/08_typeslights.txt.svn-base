::TQ1161::Fog lights are usually mounted lower then headlights and tend to be aimed to strike the road a short distance in front of the vehicle. Why is this?{
	=The light from the fog light is normally reflected up into the fog. This reduces the light reflected into the driver's eyes, providing better visibility.#Sometimes fog lights have different colored reflectors, eg yellow. Some manufacturers believe that the yellow light better penetrates the fog, giving the driver better vision.
	~Because the driving lights turn on when the headlights are dipped from high to low beam and so they are not needed to shine over greater distances.#Sometimes fog lights have different colored reflectors, eg yellow. Some manufacturers believe that the yellow light better penetrates the fog, giving the driver better vision.
	~The light from the fog light is normally reflected down. This increases the light reflected into the driver's eyes, providing better visibility.#Sometimes fog lights have different colored reflectors, eg yellow.
