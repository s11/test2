::TQ1278::In some cars, as speed increases and engine and road noise also increases so the audio volume automatically increases too. What device controls this action?{
	=The body control unit.#The body control system allows for features such as the interruption or replacement of audio entertainment when there is an incoming phone call, or simply muting the audio to allow a hands-free phone conversation. The control unit usually has an input from the vehicle speed sensor, which allows it to gradually increase audio system volume proportionally with road speed. As speed, and therefore engine and road noise increases, the audio volume increases. As speed decreases the audio volume decreases.
	~The EFI control unit.#The body control system allows for features such as the interruption or replacement of audio entertainment when there is an incoming phone call, or simply muting the audio to allow a hands-free phone conversation. The control unit usually has an input from the vehicle speed sensor, which allows it to gradually increase audio system volume proportionally with road speed. As speed, and therefore engine and road noise increases, the audio volume increases. As speed decreases the audio volume decreases.
	~The ECU input control.#The body control system allows for features such as the interruption or replacement of audio entertainment when there is an incoming phone call, or simply muting the audio to allow a hands-free phone conversation.

::TQ1280::Proximity sensors are only fitted to the rear of a vehicle.{
	=FALSE#Piezo type proximity sensors are used on vehicles and operate by transmitting and receiving coded sound waves. A control unit determines the distance between the sensor and an obstacle by measuring the time taken for the sound wave to leave and return to the sensor. Normally 4 sensors are used to allow for full coverage across the width of the vehicle. They can be fitted to both the front and rear of the vehicle.
