::TQ1264::A seat belt with ripped stitching:{
	=should be replaced if the stitching shows any sign of separation.#Ripped stitching is a one use safety feature used on seat belts in conjunction with an air bag and seat belt pre-tensioners. During a collision the pre-tensioners initially pull the seat belt tight and the stitching gradually tears to allow the occupant to move forward into the air bag at a controlled rate. These belts must be replaced once they have had their stitching ripped. They are generally fitted with warning labels that indicate the belt is to be replaced when the label is revealed.

::TQ1265::All seat belt pre-tensioners use pyrotechnics to actuate them.{
	=FALSE#Seatbelt pre-tensioners are used to tighten the seatbelt in a severe frontal accident. Both mechanical and electronic control systems are available. The most common type relies upon an explosive charge that is detonated electronically by a sensor within the seatbelt tensioning mechanism. However mechanical systems are available and rely on inertia to move a sensing mass. This releases a spring to pull on a cable, thus tightening the belt.
