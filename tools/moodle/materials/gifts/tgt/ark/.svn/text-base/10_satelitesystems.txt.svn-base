::TQ1285::What is the minimum number of satellites a Global Positioning System (GPS) uses as its reference points?{
	=Four.#Global Positioning System or GPS, can be used to determine the exact location of a vehicle on the earth's surface. GPS uses a group of at least 24 satellites orbiting approximately 12 600 miles or 20 200 kilometers above the earth. The GPS receiver on the vehicle has to locate four or more of these satellites, determine the distance to each, and use this information to establish its own location. This operation is based on a mathematical principle called 'triangulation'.
