::TQ1348::Technician A says that liquids transmit force. Technician B says that liquids increase force. Who is correct?{
	=Technician A.#Technician A is correct because Pascal's Law states that if pressure is applied to a non-flowing fluid in a container then that pressure is transmitted equally in all directions within the container. If the size of the container is changed then the pressure and movement will also change in proportion with the change in size. Force is not amplified by the liquid.
