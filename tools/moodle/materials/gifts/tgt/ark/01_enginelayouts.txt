::TQ0090::Engines in modern vehicles can be manufactured in which of these configurations?{
	=All of these.#Engines in a range of variations can be used in vehicles. Normally the manufacturer chooses a particular configuration depending on a number of factors. This may include body design and desired power output for a given size of vehicle and drive configuration.
