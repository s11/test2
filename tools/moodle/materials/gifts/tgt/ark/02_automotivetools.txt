::TQ0153::What is the purpose of the flat washer used under a nut?{
	=To protect the surface underneath the nut.#The purpose of a flat washer used under a nut is normally to protect the metal underneath the nut that it is being tightened on. The nut itself (if a washer is not used) can sometimes pull itself through the hole as it tightens onto its partner fastener (the bolt). The flat washer prevents this. There is a range of washers that can be used including shake-proof and spring which act as locking devices, however the flat washer although not a locking device is the only type of washer that can spread the tensile load inflicted on the components being joined by the fastener.
