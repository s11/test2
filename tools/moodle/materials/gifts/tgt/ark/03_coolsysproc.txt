::TQ1648::Removing the radiator cap of a hot engine may cause:{
	=immediate boiling of the coolant.#Most automotive cooling systems are sealed and pressurized. This is to raise the normal boiling point of the coolant. Typically a 15lb cap will raise the boiling point of the coolant by nearly 22.5 degrees C or 60.75 degrees F. As a radiator or pressure cap increases the boiling point of the coolant in proportion to the spring tension in the cap, the removal of the radiator cap from the radiator of a hot engine may cause immediate boiling of the coolant.

::TQ1649::Which of the following statements is correct?{
	=Never drain and refill the cooling system of a hot engine. Wait for it to cool first.#Beware when draining cooling systems as coolant temperature can exceeed 100 degrees Centigrade. Ensure that waste coolant is disposed of in accordance with local authority regulations.
	~The cooling system should be at operating temperature prior to draining.#Beware when draining cooling systems as coolant temperature can exceeed 100 degrees Centigrade. Ensure that waste coolant is disposed of in accordance with local authority regulations.
	~Always ensure that the cooling system is hot prior to draining the system.#Beware when draining cooling systems as coolant temperature can exceeed 100 degrees Centigrade. Ensure that waste coolant is disposed of in accordance with local authority regulations.
	~Run the engine for 30 minutes before draining the cooling system.#Beware when draining cooling systems as coolant temperature can exceeed 100 degrees Centigrade. Ensure that waste coolant is disposed of in accordance with local authority regulations.

::TQ1650::What should you ensure prior to assessing the condition of coolant hoses? {
	=The engine is cool and turned off.#Damaged coolant hoses can be very unpredictable and can burst when disturbed. Be careful to ensure that there is no hot coolant under pressure contained in the coolant hose being examined.
	~The engine is hot and turned off.#Damaged coolant hoses can be very unpredictable and can burst when disturbed. Be careful to ensure that there is no hot coolant under pressure contained in the coolant hose being examined.
	~The engine is cold and running.#Damaged coolant hoses can be very unpredictable and can burst when disturbed. Be careful to ensure that there is no hot coolant under pressure contained in the coolant hose being examined.
	~The engine is running with AC switched on.#Damaged coolant hoses can be very unpredictable and can burst when disturbed. Be careful to ensure that there is no hot coolant under pressure contained in the coolant hose being examined.
