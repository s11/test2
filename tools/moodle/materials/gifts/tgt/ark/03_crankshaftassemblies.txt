::TQ1521::Passageways may be drilled in the crankshaft between the main bearing journals and the rod journals to:{
	=maintain oil wedge between the shaft and the bearing.#Oil flow maintains the oil wedge between the shaft and bearing, and carries away particles that could cause wear.
	~eliminate stress.#Oil flow maintains the oil wedge between the shaft and bearing, and carries away particles that could cause wear.
	~assist crankshaft cooling.#Oil flow maintains the oil wedge between the shaft and bearing, and carries away particles that could cause wear.
	~reduce torsional vibration.#Oil flow maintains the oil wedge between the shaft and bearing, and carries away particles that could cause wear.

::TQ1522::How is the soft bearing surface of engine slipper or shell bearings protected from damage by the hardened crankshaft?{
	=The crankshaft runs on a thin wedge of oil.#The soft bearing surface also allows any hard abrasive particles to become embedded in the surface. They can become so deeply embedded, they are prevented from touching the rotating shaft by the film of oil.
	~The bearing work-hardens.#The soft bearing surface also allows any hard abrasive particles to become embedded in the surface. They can become so deeply embedded, they are prevented from touching the rotating shaft by the film of oil.
	~Anti-wear additives protect the bearings.#The soft bearing surface also allows any hard abrasive particles to become embedded in the surface. They can become so deeply embedded, they are prevented from touching the rotating shaft by the film of oil.
	~Small particles prevent metal to metal contact.#The soft bearing surface also allows any hard abrasive particles to become embedded in the surface. They can become so deeply embedded, they are prevented from touching the rotating shaft by the film of oil.

::TQ1525::Why does a vehicle with automatic transmission use a light drive plate instead of a flywheel?{
	=The torque converter adds extra weight needed.#On a car with automatic transmission, the flywheel is usually called a drive or flex plate. The drive plate is lighter than a conventional flywheel because of the weight provided by the torque converter.
	~Automatic transmissions absorb engine vibration.#On a car with automatic transmission, the flywheel is usually called a drive or flex plate. The drive plate is lighter than a conventional flywheel because of the weight provided by the torque converter.
	~Automatic transmission engines idle faster.#On a car with automatic transmission, the flywheel is usually called a drive or flex plate. The drive plate is lighter than a conventional flywheel because of the weight provided by the torque converter.
	~Automatics are not as powerful.#On a car with automatic transmission, the flywheel is usually called a drive or flex plate. The drive plate is lighter than a conventional flywheel because of the weight provided by the torque converter.
