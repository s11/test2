::TQ1600::Technicians are repairing an engine that has failed. They are working on assembling the engine: Technician A says that a properly overhauled engine should start easily. Technician B says that there is no need to prime the engine to ensure it has fuel in the injectors. Who is right?{
	=Technician A.#Technician A is correct as most engines should start within 20 seconds if all correct procedures have been followed. It is good practice to cycle the key a number of times to prime the fuel system.

::TQ1602::If the engine has a distributor, what is the sequence for checking the high tension leads are correctly connected?{
	=1. Wind the engine over by hand and set the valve timing to number 1. 2. Check direction of rotation. 3. Check the position of number 1 plug lead. 4. Following the firing order, check that each HT lead is connected to the appropriate spark plug.#If your engine has a distributor, double check the wiring sequence of the plug wires. This particular distributor rotates clockwise, so starting from the number one tower that we labeled earlier, we count the firing order in a clockwise direction and then follow each of the wires to the corresponding spark plug to make sure everything is in order.
