::TQ1512::An engine's compression ratio can be determined in the following way:{
	=By comparing swept volume plus clearance volume, to clearance volume only and putting these volumes into a ratio.#Compression ratio is a fractional expression of the change in overall volume when a piston moves from BDC to TDC.  Therefore it's the sum of sweep plus clearance divided by clearance.
	~By comparing swept volume less clearance volume, to clearance volume only and putting these volumes into a ratio.#Compression ratio is a fractional expression of the change in overall volume when a piston moves from BDC to TDC.  Therefore it's the sum of sweep plus clearance divided by clearance.

::TQ1514::The purpose of the connecting rod is to:{
	=join the reciprocating components to the rotary motion components.#The connecting rod fastened at one end to the piston and at the other end to the crankshaft turns reciprocating action into rotary action. Using reciprocating motion to make rotary motion and vice versa has many applications.
	~join the camshaft to the pistons.#The connecting rod fastened at one end to the piston and at the other end to the crankshaft turns reciprocating action into rotary action. Using reciprocating motion to make rotary motion and vice versa has many applications.
	~allow continuous movement of the pistons.#The connecting rod fastened at one end to the piston and at the other end to the crankshaft turns reciprocating action into rotary action. Using reciprocating motion to make rotary motion and vice versa has many applications.
	~hold the connecting components together.#The connecting rod fastened at one end to the piston and at the other end to the crankshaft turns reciprocating action into rotary action. Using reciprocating motion to make rotary motion and vice versa has many applications.

::TQ1516::What is the purpose of the long horizontal slots in the vicinity of the oil control ring found on many pistons?{
	=To allow oil to return to the sump.#It can be a one-piece ring that depends on its own tension to hold it against the cylinder walls. Slots in the ring and holes in the piston behind the ring let oil return to the sump.
	~To allow oil into the combustion chamber.#It can be a one-piece ring that depends on its own tension to hold it against the cylinder walls. Slots in the ring and holes in the piston behind the ring let oil return to the sump.

::TQ1517::Many pistons are oval-ground to:{
	=allow for more metal expanding around the gudgeon pin.#All pistons expand as they heat up. As there is more metal near the gudgeon pin, this area tends to expand the most. To allow for this, many pistons are machined into a slightly oval shape. This is called cam grinding.
