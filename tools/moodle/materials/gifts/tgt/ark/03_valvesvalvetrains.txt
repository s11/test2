::TQ1497::The exhaust valve seat is made wider than the inlet valve seat because:{
	=the exhaust valve seat is subject to higher temperatures in operation.#The width of the valve seat is important. A narrow seat is desirable because a thin circular contact with the valve face forms an efficient seal. But a wider seat is better for transferring heat from the valve to the cylinder head. A common compromise is for the inlet valve to have a narrower seat than the exhaust valve.

	=hardened iron alloy.#Valve seats are often ground to the same angle as the valve face, but they can differ. The difference is called an interference angle.

	~After combustion, the volume of exhaust is less than the volume of air-fuel mixture.#They are usually larger than exhaust valves because the pressure forcing the charge into the cylinder is much lower than the pressure forcing the exhaust gases out of the cylinder. Exhaust gases under pressure need much less space.
	~Intake has to occur in less time. Evacuating the exhaust gases can be done more slowly.#They are usually larger than exhaust valves because the pressure forcing the charge into the cylinder is much lower than the pressure forcing the exhaust gases out of the cylinder.
