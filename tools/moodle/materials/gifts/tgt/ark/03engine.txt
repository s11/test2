Ensure the bearings and crankshaft have a light smear of oil over them before installing the crankshaft.                            4. Carefully lower crankshaft into position.                  5. Install thrust bearings.#Don't hammer on the bearings you should be able to press them all in by hand, Put a drop of oil on each bearing and wipe it very thin and evenly. It is not a good idea to lay a crankshaft on totally dry bearings.Every engine has one main journal that will have a thrust bearing installed in it. This bearing is the one that will limit the forward or backward movement of the crankshaft in the block. Make sure to wipe some oil on the thrust surface of the thrust bearing as well. The crankshaft will be rubbing on the thrust face of the bearing at these two points.  Ask for some lifting help if you need it, and then gently set the crank into the block.

::TQ1682::Which component in the lubrication system regulates the oil pressure?{
	=The pressure relief valve.#Many lubrication systems are provided with a relief valve. Its purpose is to protect and regulate the lubricating system against excessive oil pressure when the engine is operating under particular conditions (such as when it is in the warm up cycle). When it operates, the relief valve allows oil past it and returns it directly back to the sump.
