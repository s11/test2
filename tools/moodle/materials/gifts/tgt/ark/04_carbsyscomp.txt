::TQ0300::One advantage of an electric fuel pump in a carburetor fuel system is that it:{
	=fills the carburetor before the engine cranks for starting.#An electric fuel pump can produce almost instant fuel pressure.  A mechanical pump slowly builds pressure as the engine is cranked for starting.
	~pumps at a higher pressure than a mechanical one.#An electric fuel pump can produce almost instant fuel pressure.  A mechanical pump slowly builds pressure as the engine is cranked for starting.
