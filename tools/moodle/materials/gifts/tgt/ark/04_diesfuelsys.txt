::TQ0343::What is the name given to diesel fuel when its temperature is at the point where the fuel is no longer transparent?{
	=The 'Cloud Point'.#Cloud Point is the temperature at which waxy solids first appear during cooling of diesel fuel. Keeping diesel fuel at cloud point over an extended period of time or cooling the fuel further will result in more extensive formation of wax solids.
	~The 'Whey Point'.#Cloud Point is the temperature at which waxy solids first appear during cooling of diesel fuel. Keeping diesel fuel at cloud point over an extended period of time or cooling the fuel further will result in more extensive formation of wax solids.
	~The 'Freeze Point'.#Cloud Point is the temperature at which waxy solids first appear during cooling of diesel fuel. Keeping diesel fuel at cloud point over an extended period of time or cooling the fuel further will result in more extensive formation of wax solids.

::TQ0344::Diesel engine speed is controlled by:{
	=the quantity of fuel injected into the engine.#The amount of fuel injected is varied to suit the load on the engine and to control engine speed.

	=fuel tank.#In light commercial diesel engines two fuel lines are used. One carries fuel from the tank to the filters and then to the fuel injection pump. The other is the return line. It carries fuel back to the tank. Fuel is used for lubricating and cooling the injectors, the injector pump, and for bleeding the filters.

::TQ0346::What controls the rising characteristic of a diesel engine fuel injection system?{
	=The governor system.#A mechanical governor uses rotating fly weights to control movement of the fuel control rack against a spring. Removing the load from the engine lets its speed rise. Centrifugal force pushes out the weights, which push a sleeve against the spring. The force from the spring tries to push the rack to the maximum fuel position. The force on the sleeve from the fly weights acts against the spring to try to push the rack to the minimum fuel position.
