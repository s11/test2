	=Yes, the ECU has the ability to control a number of ignition and fuel system components including the injectors and the fuel pump during operation.#The ECU receives inputs from various sensors, upon which it makes decisions in relation to spark timing and the amount of fuel required by the engine.
	~No, the ECU only has the ability to control fuel system components.#The ECU receives inputs from various sensors, upon which it makes decisions in relation to spark timing and the amount of fuel required by the engine.

::TQ0392::When engine speed reaches a programmed maximum, the fuel injection pulses can be suppressed. In some systems the fuel injectors are turned off at a pre-set engine speed. Once the engine speed has slowed to a safe value the injectors are turned back on. What is this called?{
	=A hard limiter.#Other systems use soft limiters where once a pre-set engine speed has been reached, the injector pulse width is reduced to prevent the engine from turning any faster.
	~A soft limiter.#Other systems use soft limiters where once a pre-set engine speed has been reached, the injector pulse width is reduced to prevent the engine from turning any faster.
