::TQ0421::What does the term activated charcoal mean?{
	=The term 'activated' charcoal means that the charcoal material is porous and has a large surface area and can store large quantities of fuel vapor.#Activated charcoal is charcoal that has been treated with oxygen to open up millions of tiny pores between the carbon atoms.  Therefore, these particles are able to remove and store vapors (HC) found within the evaporative emission system. Additionally, the activated charcoal easily releases the vapors when fresh air is passed through the carbon canister on its way to the intake manifold.
