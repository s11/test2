::TQ0558::How does a torsion bar spring operate and what determines the strength of the spring?{
	=The torsion bar supports the vehicle load and twists around its center to provide the springing action. The spring rate depends upon the length of the bar. The shorter and thicker the bar, the stiffer its spring rate.#After a lot of use, a torsion bar can sag. On many vehicles, it can be adjusted to allow for this. It is used in light vehicles as a stabilizer, or anti-roll bar, connected between each side of the suspension on the front, and sometimes the rear.
