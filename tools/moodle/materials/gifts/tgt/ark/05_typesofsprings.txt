::TQ0531::Barrel-shaped springs:{
	=have longer suspension travel than cylindrical springs.#A spring with a progressive rate deflects readily under a light load, but increases its resistance as the load increases. This gives a softer ride. As conical and barrel-shaped springs compress, they collapse into themselves. This gives a longer suspension travel for the length of the spring than for a cylindrical spring. This gives a softer ride for light-load situations, and a harder ride for heavy load situations.
