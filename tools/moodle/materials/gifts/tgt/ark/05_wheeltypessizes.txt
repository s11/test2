::TQ0584::Custom wheels can be made of:{
	=all of these.#Wheels can also be made from cast aluminum alloy. Alloy wheels are popular because of their appearance and because they are lighter than similar steel wheels. Aluminum is a better conductor of heat, so alloy wheels can dissipate heat from brakes and tires more effectively than steel ones. These are often called mag or magnesium wheels, but wheels made of magnesium are rarely used on road vehicles.
