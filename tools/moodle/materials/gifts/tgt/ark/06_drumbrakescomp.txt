::TQ0699::The composition of the friction material on drum brakes affects brake operation. Linings which provide good braking with low pedal pressures:{
	=tend to lose efficiency when they get hot.#Linings which maintain a stable friction co-efficient over a wide temperature range generally require higher pedal pressures to provide efficient braking, and may need the use of a booster.
	~tend to lose efficiency when they cool down.#Linings which maintain a stable friction co-efficient over a wide temperature range generally require higher pedal pressures to provide efficient braking, and may need the use of a booster.
	~tend to lose efficiency over time.#Linings which maintain a stable friction co-efficient over a wide temperature range generally require higher pedal pressures to provide efficient braking, and may need the use of a booster.

::TQ0700::The main advantage claimed for drum brakes is that the shoe mounting can be designed to assist its own operation. This is called:{
	=self-energization.#The primary function of the brake drum assembly is to force the brake shoes against the rotating drum to provide the braking action. When the brake shoes are forced against the rotating drum they are pulled away from their pivot point by friction.  This movement, called self-energizing action, draws the shoes tighter against the drum.

When the brake shoes are forced against the rotating drum they are pulled away from their pivot point by friction.
