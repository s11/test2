::TQ0932::In an all-wheel drive vehicle, the differences in the rotational speeds of the front and rear propeller shafts is catered for by using:{

To reduce this action of the third differential operation, a viscous coupling unit between the differential case and the rear output shaft acts as a limited slip differential.

::TQ0933::What does the viscous coupling do?{
	=Torque is transferred through the coupling by the high viscosity of the silicone fluid sealed in the unit.  #The outer plates of the viscous coupling are splined to the differential case and the inner plates are splined to the output shaft.  As the fluid expands when it is heated, the unit is only filled to about 80% of its capacity. 
	~Torque is transferred through the coupling by locking the gears inside the coupling together.#The outer plates of the viscous coupling are splined to the differential case and the inner plates are splined to the output shaft.  As the fluid expands when it is heated, the unit is only filled to about 80% of its capacity.
