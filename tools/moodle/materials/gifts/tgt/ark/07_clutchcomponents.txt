::TQ0763::The linings of a clutch plate when disengaged are held slightly apart by spring steel segments. This is to:{
	=assist in a smooth take-up of the drive.#Clutch disc facing springs, also called the cushioning springs, are flat metal springs located under the friction lining of the disc. These springs have a slight wave or curve, allowing the lining to flex inward slightly during initial engagement. This also allows for smooth engagement.
	~allow the linings to rotate on engagement.#Clutch disc facing springs, also called the cushioning springs, are flat metal springs located under the friction lining of the disc. These springs have a slight wave or curve, allowing the lining to flex inward slightly during initial engagement. This also allows for smooth engagement.
	~prevent the clutch from slipping at high speeds.#Clutch disc facing springs, also called the cushioning springs, are flat metal springs located under the friction lining of the disc. These springs have a slight wave or curve, allowing the lining to flex inward slightly during initial engagement. This also allows for smooth engagement.
	~circulate air through the linings at all times.#Clutch disc facing springs, also called the cushioning springs, are flat metal springs located under the friction lining of the disc. These springs have a slight wave or curve, allowing the lining to flex inward slightly during initial engagement. This also allows for smooth engagement.

::TQ0764::The spring hub arrangement on the clutch center plate is designed to:{
	=absorb torsional vibrations and shock loads.#Clutch disc torsion springs, also termed damping springs, absorb some of the vibration and shock produced by clutch engagement.
	~supplement clamping force during violent engagement.#Clutch disc torsion springs, also termed damping springs, absorb some of the vibration and shock produced by clutch engagement.
	~prevent clutch slip at high speed.#Clutch disc torsion springs, also termed damping springs, absorb some of the vibration and shock produced by clutch engagement.
	~ensure positive clutch engagement.#Clutch disc torsion springs, also termed damping springs, absorb some of the vibration and shock produced by clutch engagement.
