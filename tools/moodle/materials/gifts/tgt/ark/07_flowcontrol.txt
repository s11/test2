::TQ0871::How many sections does a 1-2 shift valve have?{
	=Two. Upper and lower sections.#The 1-2 shift valve is in two sections. The shift valve itself is the lower section and this is held in its downmost position by a combination of the differential force and by the upper section plunger and spring.
	~Three. Center section plus upper and lower extensions.#The 1-2 shift valve is in two sections. The shift valve itself is the lower section and this is held in its downmost position by a combination of the differential force and by the upper section plunger and spring.
	~One. The valve is a single sealed unit.#The 1-2 shift valve is in two sections. The shift valve itself is the lower section and this is held in its downmost position by a combination of the differential force and by the upper section plunger and spring.
	~Four. Two springs, a valve, and a plunger.#The 1-2 shift valve is in two sections. The shift valve itself is the lower section and this is held in its downmost position by a combination of the differential force and by the upper section plunger and spring.

::TQ0872::Which of these is a component of a 2-3 shift valve assembly?{
	=Throttle pressure regulating plug.#With the vehicle in motion in 2nd gear and at higher throttle openings, higher throttle pressure moves the plug down towards the shift valve and this re-regulates the throttle pressure into a lower value so that it can act on the top land of the shift valve.
	~Servo pressure valve adjuster.#With the vehicle in motion in 2nd gear and at higher throttle openings, higher throttle pressure moves the plug down towards the shift valve and this re-regulates the throttle pressure into a lower value so that it can act on the top land of the shift valve.
	~Compensating pressure booster.#With the vehicle in motion in 2nd gear and at higher throttle openings, higher throttle pressure moves the plug down towards the shift valve and this re-regulates the throttle pressure into a lower value so that it can act on the top land of the shift valve.
	~Center band release circuit.#With the vehicle in motion in 2nd gear and at higher throttle openings, higher throttle pressure moves the plug down towards the shift valve and this re-regulates the throttle pressure into a lower value so that it can act on the top land of the shift valve.

::TQ0873::What determines whether a 3-2 kickdown shift can be made?{
	=Governor pressure.#When a 3-2 kickdown downshift is required, the fully depressed throttle prevents the throttle valve from regulating the incoming line pressure and throttle pressure becomes equal to line pressure.  Fluid at line pressure passes through the kickdown valve and acts on the top land of the 2-3 shift valve.
	~The force of the kickdown on the accelerator/gas pedal.#When a 3-2 kickdown downshift is required, the fully depressed throttle prevents the throttle valve from regulating the incoming line pressure and throttle pressure becomes equal to line pressure.  Fluid at line pressure passes through the kickdown valve and acts on the top land of the 2-3 shift valve.
	~Proportioning valve pressure.#When a 3-2 kickdown downshift is required, the fully depressed throttle prevents the throttle valve from regulating the incoming line pressure and throttle pressure becomes equal to line pressure.  Fluid at line pressure passes through the kickdown valve and acts on the top land of the 2-3 shift valve.
	~A combination of road speed and air intake volume.#When a 3-2 kickdown downshift is required, the fully depressed throttle prevents the throttle valve from regulating the incoming line pressure and throttle pressure becomes equal to line pressure.  Fluid at line pressure passes through the kickdown valve and acts on the top land of the 2-3 shift valve.

::TQ0874::The manual valve directs fluid at what pressure when gear position 1 is selected?{
	=Line pressure.#When gear lever position 1 is selected, the manual valve directs fluid at line pressure to the front clutch and to the rear band servo.
	~Boosted pressure.#When gear lever position 1 is selected, the manual valve directs fluid at line pressure to the front clutch and to the rear band servo.
	~Reduced pressure.#When gear lever position 1 is selected, the manual valve directs fluid at line pressure to the front clutch and to the rear band servo.
	~Atmospheric pressure.#When gear lever position 1 is selected, the manual valve directs fluid at line pressure to the front clutch and to the rear band servo.
