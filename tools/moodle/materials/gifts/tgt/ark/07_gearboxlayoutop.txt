::TQ0783::The function of the reverse idler in a transmission is to:{
	=change the direction of rotation of the mainshaft.#When reverse is selected the reverse idler connects with mating gears on the countershaft and main shaft. The reverse idler rotates on a plain shaft fixed in the casing. It transfers the drive from one shaft to the other and reverses the direction of rotation of the main shaft.
