::TQ0850::The manual valve located in an automatic transmission is normally a:{
	=control valve.#In a regulating valve from a fluid circuit the valve is forced downwards against its spring until it begins to uncover a port leading to another part of the circuit. Since the port is not fully uncovered, there is a restriction to flow and this causes a pressure drop across it. The pressure of the fluid in this part of the circuit is now less than the pressure of the fluid being supplied. If the port was fully uncovered then pressures on both sides of the valve would become equal.
