::TQ1091::What controls the timing for the distributorless ignition system?{
	=An electronic control unit or ECU.#Timing for the distributorless ignition system is controlled by an electronic control unit or ECU. The ECU decides the best time to fire the spark plugs. 
The ECU makes its decision on the best time to fire the spark plugs based on information received from sensors.

::TQ1092::In direct fire ignition what is the cylinder on compression stroke called?{
	='Event cylinder'#Each ignition coil serves two cylinders, with each end of the secondary winding attached by a high tension lead to a spark plug. These two plugs are on companion cylinders. That is, cylinders where the pistons reach top dead center at the same time. The cylinder on compression stroke is said to be the 'event cylinder' and the cylinder on the exhaust stroke is the 'waste cylinder'.

::TQ1093::What is on advantage of a system which employs an individual coil for each cylinder?{
	=It eliminates the necessity for high tension leads.#With each coil connected directly to its sparkplug eliminates the necessity for high tension leads and reduces the possibility of voltage leakage.
	~It allows the engine managament control module to minimise voltage leakage from high tension leads.#With each coil connected directly to its sparkplug eliminates the necessity for high tension leads and reduces the possibility of voltage leakage.
	~It prolongs the life of the sparkplug.#With each coil connected directly to its sparkplug eliminates the necessity for high tension leads and reduces the possibility of voltage leakage.
	~It elimates the need for a 'Waste cylinder'.#With each coil connected directly to its sparkplug eliminates the necessity for high tension leads and reduces the possibility of voltage leakage.
