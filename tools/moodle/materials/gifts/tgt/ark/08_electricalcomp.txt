::TQ1003::How is a capacitor discharged?{
	=When the circuit is closed between its terminals.#When a circuit is closed between its terminals, the capacitor releases charge. It is then said to be discharged.
	~When the circuit is opened between its terminals.#When a circuit is closed between its terminals, the capacitor releases charge. It is then said to be discharged.
	~When both surfaces are positively charged.#When a circuit is closed between its terminals, the capacitor releases charge. It is then said to be discharged.
	~When both surfaces are negatively charged.#When a circuit is closed between its terminals, the capacitor releases charge. It is then said to be discharged.
