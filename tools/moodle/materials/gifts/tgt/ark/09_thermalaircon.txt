::TQ1219::One purpose of the thermostatic expansion valve is to:{
	=change high pressure liquid to a low pressure liquid.#The expansion valve ensures a change of state occurs in the refrigerant. High pressure liquid enters the expansion valve and low pressure liquid exits the valve which quickly turns to vapor by absorbing heat from the relatively warm air flowing over the surface of the evaporator.
	~assist in cooling the compressor.#The expansion valve ensures a change of state occurs in the refrigerant. High pressure liquid enters the expansion valve and low pressure liquid exits the valve which quickly turns to vapor by absorbing heat from the relatively warm air flowing over the surface of the evaporator.
	~allow air bubbles to expand in the receiver drier.#The expansion valve ensures a change of state occurs in the refrigerant. High pressure liquid enters the expansion valve and low pressure liquid exits the valve which quickly turns to vapor by absorbing heat from the relatively warm air flowing over the surface of the evaporator.
	~reduce pressure in the condenser.#The expansion valve ensures a change of state occurs in the refrigerant. High pressure liquid enters the expansion valve and low pressure liquid exits the valve which quickly turns to vapor by absorbing heat from the relatively warm air flowing over the surface of the evaporator.
