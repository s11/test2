::TQ1271::Remote control keys and key fobs transmit a coded signal that is received by the vehicle's theft deterrent computer. How does the remote key and computer exchange information?{
	=Wireless communication is used in the form of high frequency electromagnetic fields known as Radio Frequency or RF.#The key fob and theft deterrent computer on the vehicle have to be capable of transmitting and receiving coded information. For the remote key and computer to exchange information, wireless communication is needed. High frequency electromagnetic fields known as 'Radio Frequency' or RF is used. This system relies upon the same basic technology as cell phones, TV and radio.

::TQ1272::Some vehicles have memory systems that remember a driver's preferred driving characteristics and seating positions. What normally triggers this when the vehicle has more than one driver?{
	=The vehicle entry and ignition device is coded to a particular driver and the device communicates with the vehicle body systems to set and remember the preferences.#When keyless entry is used, personalization of systems is possible. They can be programmed to recognize different keys, with each driver having their own specific key. This allows for different settings to be made that are individual to each driver. Specific settings are remembered from that key, so the seat, steering wheel and mirror position automatically adjusts to the driver as well as climate control and entertainment system settings.
