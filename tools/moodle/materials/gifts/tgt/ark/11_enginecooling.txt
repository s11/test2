::TQ1329::If water is put under higher than atmospheric pressure:{
	=it boils at a higher temperature.#Changing water pressure changes the temperature at which it boils.
	~it boils at a lower temperature.#Changing water pressure changes the temperature at which it boils.
	~it boils at standard 'boiling point'.#Changing water pressure changes the temperature at which it boils.
	~it doesn't boil.#Changing water pressure changes the temperature at which it boils.

::TQ1330::When can centrifugal force be useful?{
	=When coolant enters a coolant pump moving the liquid outward.#Centrifugal force is a force pulling outward on a rotating body.
	~When a flywheel is out of balance.#Centrifugal force is a force pulling outward on a rotating body.
	~When a vehicle is turning a corner.#Centrifugal force is a force pulling outward on a rotating body.
	~When a vehicle is moving in a straight line.#Centrifugal force is a force pulling outward on a rotating body.

::TQ1332::Thermo-switches can be:{
	=mechanical or electrical.#Thermo-switches are designed to switch on or off when the temperature reaches a certain level.
	~electronic or magnetic.#Thermo-switches are designed to switch on or off when the temperature reaches a certain level.
	~mechanical or magnetic.#Thermo-switches are designed to switch on or off when the temperature reaches a certain level.
	~electrical or chemical.#Thermo-switches are designed to switch on or off when the temperature reaches a certain level.

//name:TQ1333
::TQ1333::How do you make the thermo-switch break the circuit?{
	=By cooling it.#Cooling the thermo-switch produces the opposite effect of heating it, breaking the circuit.
	~By reversing the current.#Cooling the thermo-switch produces the opposite effect. Breaking the circuit, and closing the passage.
	~By turning off the current.#Cooling the thermo-switch produces the opposite effect. Breaking the circuit, and closing the passage.
	~By reducing the voltage.#Cooling the thermo-switch produces the opposite effect. Breaking the circuit, and closing the passage.
