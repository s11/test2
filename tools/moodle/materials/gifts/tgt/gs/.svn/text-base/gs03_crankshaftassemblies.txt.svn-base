::TQ1520::What assists in controlling lateral movement of the crankshaft?{
	=Crankshaft thrust bearing flanges.#One main bearing has thrust faces which accept and limit the end movement of the crankshaft. These can be in the form of flanges that are part of the bearing.
	~Main bearing shells.#One main bearing has thrust faces which accept and limit the end movement of the crankshaft. These can be in the form of flanges that are part of the bearing.
	~Big end bearings.#One main bearing has thrust faces which accept and limit the end movement of the crankshaft. These can be in the form of flanges that are part of the bearing.
	~Crankshaft lateral bearings.#One main bearing has thrust faces which accept and limit the end movement of the crankshaft. These can be in the form of flanges that are part of the bearing.

::TQ1525::Why does a vehicle with automatic transmission use a light drive plate instead of a flywheel?{
	=The torque converter adds extra weight needed.#On a car with automatic transmission, the flywheel is usually called a drive or flex plate. The drive plate is lighter than a conventional flywheel because of the weight provided by the torque converter.
	~Automatic transmissions absorb engine vibration.#On a car with automatic transmission, the flywheel is usually called a drive or flex plate. The drive plate is lighter than a conventional flywheel because of the weight provided by the torque converter.
	~Automatic transmission engines idle faster.#On a car with automatic transmission, the flywheel is usually called a drive or flex plate. The drive plate is lighter than a conventional flywheel because of the weight provided by the torque converter.
	~Automatics are not as powerful.#On a car with automatic transmission, the flywheel is usually called a drive or flex plate. The drive plate is lighter than a conventional flywheel because of the weight provided by the torque converter.

::TQ1527::What holds the spring-loaded valve stems in place?{
	=Valve guides.#The valve is held in place by a valve guide, with a spring on its stem. A rocker arm is attached to a stationary shaft that allows the arm to pivot. The rocker arm compresses and releases the valve spring, so that the valve opens and closes.
	~Valve sleeves.#The valve is held in place by a valve guide, with a spring on its stem. A rocker arm is attached to a stationary shaft that allows the arm to pivot. The rocker arm compresses and releases the valve spring, so that the valve opens and closes.
	~Stem seats.#The valve is held in place by a valve guide, with a spring on its stem. A rocker arm is attached to a stationary shaft that allows the arm to pivot. The rocker arm compresses and releases the valve spring, so that the valve opens and closes.
	~Stem tubes.#The valve is held in place by a valve guide, with a spring on its stem. A rocker arm is attached to a stationary shaft that allows the arm to pivot. The rocker arm compresses and releases the valve spring, so that the valve opens and closes.
