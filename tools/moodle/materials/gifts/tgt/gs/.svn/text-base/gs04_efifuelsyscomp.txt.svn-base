::TQ0327::Which of the following statements is correct?{
	=The fuel filter is directional and must be fitted in the direction of fuel flow.#Fuel filters are directional and attention must be paid when installing to ensure the correct direction of flow. A fuel filter will commonly only fit in the correct direction of flow due to differing fittings at each end.
	~The fuel filter can be fitted any way it will fit and direction of flow is unimportant.#Fuel filters are directional and attention must be paid when installing to ensure the correct direction of flow. A fuel filter will commonly only fit in the correct direction of flow due to differing fittings at each end.
	~A fuel filter is not required with modern clean fuel technology.#Fuel filters are directional and attention must be paid when installing to ensure the correct direction of flow. A fuel filter will commonly only fit in the correct direction of flow due to differing fittings at each end.
	~Fuel filters can be removed and cleaned out with compressed air.#Fuel filters are directional and attention must be paid when installing to ensure the correct direction of flow. A fuel filter will commonly only fit in the correct direction of flow due to differing fittings at each end.

::TQ0332::A tachometric relay was used on older vehicles in order for the instrument cluster to display:{
	=engine RPM .#Early vehicles used tachometric relays to measure engine RPM. Modern vehicles use the Crank Position Sensor (CKP) to send engine RPM to the control unit.
	~vehicle speed.#Early vehicles used tachometric relays to measure engine RPM. Modern vehicles use the Crank Position Sensor (CKP) to send engine RPM to the control unit.
	~coolant temperature.#Early vehicles used tachometric relays to measure engine RPM. Modern vehicles use the Crank Position Sensor (CKP) to send engine RPM to the control unit.
	~oil pressure.#Early vehicles used tachometric relays to measure engine RPM. Modern vehicles use the Crank Position Sensor (CKP) to send engine RPM to the control unit.

::TQ0334::What does the knock sensor use to produce its signal voltage?{
	=A piezo crystal.#The knock sensor employs a piezo crystal that generates a small voltage when knock is detected.
	~A potentiometer.#The knock sensor employs a piezo crystal that generates a small voltage when knock is detected.
	~An inductive coil.#The knock sensor employs a piezo crystal that generates a small voltage when knock is detected.
	~Hall effect.#The knock sensor employs a piezo crystal that generates a small voltage when knock is detected.
