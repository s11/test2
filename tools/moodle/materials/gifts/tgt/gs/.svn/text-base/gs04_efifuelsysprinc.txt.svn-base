::TQ0316::In a basic gasoline multi-point fuel injection system, the fuel injectors are controlled by:{
	=the electronic control unit.#The actual operating time of the injectors depends very much on battery voltage. The response time to lift the injector needle to the fully-open position is about 1 millisecond. If battery voltage is low, this response time is longer and the engine receives less fuel. The ECU can compensate for this delay in opening time by extending the duration of the injection pulse. In more sophisticated engine management systems the control unit can control additional functions such as ignition timing, injection modes, idle speed, cooling fans, and fuel pump operation. To do this however, more inputs are needed.
