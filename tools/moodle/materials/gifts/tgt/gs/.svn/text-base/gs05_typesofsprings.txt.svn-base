::TQ0530::A coil spring in which the wire diameter decreases towards the end is a:{
	=progressive-rate spring.#Progressive-rate springs become stiffer as they are compressed, unlike single-rate springs which have a fixed spring rate.
	~controlled-rate spring.#Progressive-rate springs become stiffer as they are compressed, unlike single-rate springs which have a fixed spring rate.
	~adjustable-rate spring.#Progressive-rate springs become stiffer as they are compressed, unlike single-rate springs which have a fixed spring rate.

::TQ0531::Barrel-shaped springs:{
	=have longer suspension travel than cylindrical springs.#A spring with a progressive rate deflects readily under a light load, but increases its resistance as the load increases. This gives a softer ride. As conical and barrel-shaped springs compress, they collapse into themselves. This gives a longer suspension travel for the length of the spring than for a cylindrical spring. This gives a softer ride for light-load situations, and a harder ride for heavy load situations.
	~exhibit constant deflection rate.#A spring with a progressive rate deflects readily under a light load, but increases its resistance as the load increases. This gives a softer ride. As conical and barrel-shaped springs compress, they collapse into themselves. This gives a longer suspension travel for the length of the spring than for a cylindrical spring.

::TQ0532::Coil springs are color coded at the time of manufacture. What does this code indicate?{
	=The different load ratings for the spring.#Generally, a cylindrical spring with uniform diameter wire and uniform pitch has a constant deflection rate. Its length reduces in direct proportion to the load applied. Manufacturers color code the springs to indicate that spring's particular load rating.
	~The limit of its safe travel in compression and extension.#Generally, a cylindrical spring with uniform diameter wire and uniform pitch has a constant deflection rate. Its length reduces in direct proportion to the load applied. Manufacturers color code the springs to indicate that spring's particular load rating.
	~The desired location of the spring on a vehicle.#Generally, a cylindrical spring with uniform diameter wire and uniform pitch has a constant deflection rate. Its length reduces in direct proportion to the load applied. Manufacturers color code the springs to indicate that spring's particular load rating.
	~The date and place of manufacture.#Generally, a cylindrical spring with uniform diameter wire and uniform pitch has a constant deflection rate. Its length reduces in direct proportion to the load applied. Manufacturers color code the springs to indicate that spring's particular load rating.

::TQ0534::The stiffness of a coil spring can be increased by:{
	=increasing the diameter of the wire.#The load carrying ability of the spring depends on the diameter of the wire, the overall diameter of the spring, its shape, and the spacing of the coils.
	~stretching the spring.#The load carrying ability of the spring depends on the diameter of the wire, the overall diameter of the spring, its shape, and the spacing of the coils.
	~reducing the diameter of the wire.#The load carrying ability of the spring depends on the diameter of the wire, the overall diameter of the spring, its shape, and the spacing of the coils.
	~reducing the weight of the spring.#The load carrying ability of the spring depends on the diameter of the wire, the overall diameter of the spring, its shape, and the spacing of the coils.

::TQ0539::Some vehicles have rubber springs attached to their coil spring suspensions. What is their purpose?{
	=To prevent 'metal to metal' contact of the suspension parts when the coil springs are compressed.#Coil springs can look alike but have very different load ratings which are often color coded for identification. They normally use rubber pads to prevent transmission of noise and vibration.
	~To further increase the load ratings of color coded coil springs.#Coil springs can look alike but have very different load ratings which are often color coded for identification. They normally use rubber pads to prevent transmission of noise and vibration.
