	=materials of the pad and disc.#The coefficient of friction (also known as the frictional coefficient or the friction coefficient) is a scalar value used to calculate the force of friction between two bodies. The coefficient of friction depends on the materials used.

It is interesting to note that contrary to common belief, the force of friction is invariant to the size of the contact area between the two objects. This means that friction does not depend on the size of the objects.
