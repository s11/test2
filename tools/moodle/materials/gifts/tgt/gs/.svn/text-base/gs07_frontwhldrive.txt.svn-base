::TQ0901::The universal joint is designed to allow for changes in:{
	=shaft length and horizontal angle.#Universal joints let the shaft keep rotating while allowing for changes due to suspension movement such as shaft length, horizontal angle and shaft angle as the steering turns.
	~angular change but not shaft length.#Universal joints let the shaft keep rotating while allowing for changes due to suspension movement such as shaft length, horizontal angle and shaft angle as the steering turns.
