::TQ1152::A lamp filament does not burn out because air in the lamp is replaced with:{
	=inert gas.#The inert gas ensures there is no atmosphere present to support the burning of the filament.
	~oxygen.#The inert gas ensures there is no atmosphere present to support the burning of the filament.
	~air.#The inert gas ensures there is no atmosphere present to support the burning of the filament.
	~nitrogen.#The inert gas ensures there is no atmosphere present to support the burning of the filament.

::TQ1155::A 24V 21W bulb consumes more power than a 12 V 21W bulb.{
	=FALSE#21 watt refers to the rate at which the bulb does work. Bulbs are designed to use energy as defined by their rated wattage at a certain voltage. Both bulbs are doing the same amount of work.
	~TRUE#21 watt refers to the rate at which the bulb does work. Bulbs are designed to use energy as defined by their rated wattage at a certain voltage. Both bulbs are doing the same amount of work.
