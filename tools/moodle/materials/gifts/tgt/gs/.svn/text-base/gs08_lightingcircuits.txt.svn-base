::TQ1172::Why are vehicles fitted with lighting systems in parallel to each other?{
	=Because if one system fails the others can still work independently of the failed system.#Strategies like separate fuses and circuits and the use of circuit breakers provide some redundancy in vehicle electrical circuits.
	~Because it is simpler to construct in the first place.#Strategies like separate fuses and circuits and the use of circuit breakers provide some redundancy in vehicle electrical circuits.
	~Because one system operates off the other and it is easier to trace faults when a lamp fails.#Strategies like separate fuses and circuits and the use of circuit breakers provide some redundancy in vehicle electrical circuits.
	~Because one fuse can be used for all systems.#Strategies like separate fuses and circuits and the use of circuit breakers provide some redundancy in vehicle electrical circuits.
