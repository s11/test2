::TQ1505::In relation to a gasoline or petrol engine the acronym 'SOHC' represents:{
	=single overhead camshaft.#Single overhead camshafts can use rocker arms. The cam can lift one end of the rocker arm, or it can press down on the rocker arm.
	~single overhead crankshaft.#Single overhead camshafts can use rocker arms. The cam can lift one end of the rocker arm, or it can press down on the rocker arm.
	~short overhead crankshaft.#Single overhead camshafts can use rocker arms. The cam can lift one end of the rocker arm, or it can press down on the rocker arm.
	~supported overhead camshaft.#Single overhead camshafts can use rocker arms. The cam can lift one end of the rocker arm, or it can press down on the rocker arm.

::TQ1506::The component that operates between the valve and the camshaft in an overhead cam engine is the:{
	=rocker arm.#Overhead camshafts can use rocker arms. The cam can lift one end of the rocker arm, or it can press down on the rocker arm.
	~pushrod.#Overhead camshafts can use rocker arms. The cam can lift one end of the rocker arm, or it can press down on the rocker arm.
	~valve spring retainer.#Overhead camshafts can use rocker arms. The cam can lift one end of the rocker arm, or it can press down on the rocker arm.
	~valve rotator.#Overhead camshafts can use rocker arms. The cam can lift one end of the rocker arm, or it can press down on the rocker arm.

::TQ1507::An overhead camshaft is driven by:{
	=timing chain or belt.#Timing belts and chains are used on overhead camshaft engines because the camshaft is further from the crankshaft.
	~timing sprocket.#Timing belts and chains are used on overhead camshaft engines because the camshaft is further from the crankshaft.
	~timing gear.#Timing belts and chains are used on overhead camshaft engines because the camshaft is further from the crankshaft.
	~timing idler belt or sprocket.#Timing belts and chains are used on overhead camshaft engines because the camshaft is further from the crankshaft.

::TQ1508::The purpose of the timing chain guides is:{
	=to reduce noise and vibrations.#A typical chain drive system uses a hydraulic tensioner which is fed by oil under pressure from the lubrication system. The chain also uses guides to reduce noise and vibration.
	~to make sure the chain has the correct tension.#A typical chain drive system uses a hydraulic tensioner which is fed by oil under pressure from the lubrication system. The chain also uses guides to reduce noise and vibration.
	~to make sure the chain has an appropriate amount of lubrication directed to it.#A typical chain drive system uses a hydraulic tensioner which is fed by oil under pressure from the lubrication system. The chain also uses guides to reduce noise and vibration.
	~to reduce chain wear.#A typical chain drive system uses a hydraulic tensioner which is fed by oil under pressure from the lubrication system. The chain also uses guides to reduce noise and vibration.

::TQ1510::What is the function of a camshaft eccentric?{
	=It operates the fuel pump.#The camshaft can be cast or machined. It drives the valves and the distributor. It has a cam for each valve. Some also have a cam known as an eccentric to drive the fuel pump.
	~It counterbalances the valve cams.#The camshaft can be cast or machined. It drives the valves and the distributor. It has a cam for each valve. Some also have a cam known as an eccentric to drive the fuel pump.
	~It prevents oscillation in the rotating camshaft.#The camshaft can be cast or machined. It drives the valves and the distributor. It has a cam for each valve. Some also have a cam known as an eccentric to drive the fuel pump.
	~It meshes with the timing belt of chain from the crankshaft.#The camshaft can be cast or machined. It drives the valves and the distributor. It has a cam for each valve. Some also have a cam known as an eccentric to drive the fuel pump.

::TQ1511::When the valve is fully open, which part of the cam lobe is making contact?{
	=The nose.#The cam lobe opens a valve at the proper time and gives it proper lift. It lets it stay open for a sufficient time, then lets it close at the proper time. Accurate valve timing is crucial.
	~The heel.#The cam lobe opens a valve at the proper time and gives it proper lift. It lets it stay open for a sufficient time, then lets it close at the proper time. Accurate valve timing is crucial.
	~The ramp.#The cam lobe opens a valve at the proper time and gives it proper lift. It lets it stay open for a sufficient time, then lets it close at the proper time. Accurate valve timing is crucial.
	~The base.#The cam lobe opens a valve at the proper time and gives it proper lift. It lets it stay open for a sufficient time, then lets it close at the proper time. Accurate valve timing is crucial.
