::TQ1667::In all 2-stroke engines, oil and fuel are mixed together in the correct ratios in the fuel tank to lubricate the engine.{
	=FALSE#Two-stroke engines mix lubricants, two-stroke oil, with their fuel (either manually at refueling or by injecting oil into the fuel stream). This mixture lubricates the cylinder, crankshaft and connecting rod bearings. The lubricant is subsequently burned, resulting in undesirable emissions. An independent lubrication system from below, as is used in four-stroke designs, cannot be used in the above-described engine design, since the crankcase is being used to hold the air-fuel mixture.
