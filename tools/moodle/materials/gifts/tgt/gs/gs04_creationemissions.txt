::TQ0406::As result of combustion of the fuel and the air in an uncontrolled engine, what would be the approximate % of emissions that would come from the exhaust?{
	=0.6#The term 'emission' normally refers to the pollution produced by a vehicle during normal use. Emission control systems are designed to limit the pollution caused by the harmful products of storing and burning fuel. 
	~0.4#The term 'emission' normally refers to the pollution produced by a vehicle during normal use. Emission control systems are designed to limit the pollution caused by the harmful products of storing and burning fuel.

::TQ0407::What happens to the air/fuel mixture if a manifold is too cold?{
	=It creates a lean mixture.#A lean mixture may cause incomplete combustion. Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions are highest from a cold engine.

::TQ0409::Where in a vehicle do evaporative emissions emanate from?{
	=The fuel tank and carburetor.#The fuel tank and carburetor allow fuel to evaporate and escape to the atmosphere. These are called evaporative emissions.
	~The exhaust system.#The fuel tank and carburetor allow fuel to evaporate and escape to the atmosphere. These are called evaporative emissions.
	~The fuel injection system.#The fuel tank and carburetor allow fuel to evaporate and escape to the atmosphere. These are called evaporative emissions.
	~The crankcase.#The fuel tank and carburetor allow fuel to evaporate and escape to the atmosphere. These are called evaporative emissions.
