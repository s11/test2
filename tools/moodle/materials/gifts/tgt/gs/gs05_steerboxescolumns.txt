::TQ0470::What is the purpose of the power steering pressure relief valve?{
	=To prevent excessive pressures developing when the steering is on full-lock.#Hydraulically assisted steering systems require a pressure relief valve when the system is under extreme load or at full turn stops. This prevents damage to the system.
	~To prevent excessive pressures developing when minimal force is applied to the steering system.#Hydraulically assisted steering systems require a pressure relief valve when the system is under extreme load or at full turn stops. This prevents damage to the system.
	~To eliminate pressure drop.#Hydraulically assisted steering systems require a pressure relief valve when the system is under extreme load or at full turn stops. This prevents damage to the system.
	~To maintain high pressure during steering.#Hydraulically assisted steering systems require a pressure relief valve when the system is under extreme load or at full turn stops. This prevents damage to the system.
