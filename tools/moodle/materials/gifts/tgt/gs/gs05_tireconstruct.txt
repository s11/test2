::TQ0603::Natural rubber is mainly used in tire sidewalls and not in the tread of the tire. This is because:{
	=natural rubber is weaker than synthetic rubber.#The tire tread must endure rugged duty while the sidewall must be flexible.
	~natural rubber is stronger than synthetic rubber.#The tire tread must endure rugged duty while the sidewall must be flexible.
	~natural rubber is more expensive.#The tire tread must endure rugged duty while the sidewall must be flexible.
	~natural rubber holds the shape of the sidewall better than synthetic rubber.#The tire tread must endure rugged duty while the sidewall must be flexible.

::TQ0608::A tire with an aspect ratio of 45% is a:{
	=low profile tire.#The aspect ratio of a tire is the ratio of its height to its width. It's usually given as a percentage. The lower a tire's aspect ratio, the wider the tire is in relation to its height.
	~high profile tire.#The aspect ratio of a tire is the ratio of its height to its width. It's usually given as a percentage. The lower a tire's aspect ratio, the wider the tire is in relation to its height.
	~small bead tire.#The aspect ratio of a tire is the ratio of its height to its width. It's usually given as a percentage. The lower a tire's aspect ratio, the wider the tire is in relation to its height.
