::TQ0588::The main function of grooves in the tread pattern is to:{
	=clear water from the contact patch.#Grooves in the tread pattern clear water away from the contact patch area. This allows a relatively 'dry area' to be formed and for road adhesion to be maintained.
	~reduce road noise intrusion.#Grooves in the tread pattern clear water away from the contact patch area. This allows a relatively 'dry area' to be formed and for road adhesion to be maintained.
	~indicate when the tire is worn out.#Grooves in the tread pattern clear water away from the contact patch area. This allows a relatively 'dry area' to be formed and for road adhesion to be maintained.
	~increase traction on dry surfaces.#Grooves in the tread pattern clear water away from the contact patch area. This allows a relatively 'dry area' to be formed and for road adhesion to be maintained.

::TQ0589::Tubeless tires have no inner tubes because they have:{
	=a soft-rubber inner-casing liner.#In tubeless tire construction a soft rubber liner prevents air leaks into the plies.

::TQ0590::In radial tires the bracing belt cords run:{
	=15¯ to the direction of travel.#Radial ply tires always have a two-piece construction including a one or multiple-layered carcass and a multiple-layered belt structure. The cords go radially from one bead wire to another. The belts are at a small angle to each other (15-20 degrees).

::TQ0591::Radial ply tires have:{
	=softer sidewalls than bias ply tires.#Reduced material thickness in the sidewall section means the tire sidewalls are softer and heat up less. Also the high speed strength is further increased.
	~larger sidewalls than bias ply tires.#Reduced material thickness in the sidewall section means the tire sidewalls are softer and heat up less. Also the high speed strength is further increased.
	~smaller sidewalls than bias ply tires.#Reduced material thickness in the sidewall section means the tire sidewalls are softer and heat up less. Also the high speed strength is further increased.
