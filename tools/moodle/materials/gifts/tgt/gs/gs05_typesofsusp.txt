::TQ0522::A basic suspension system consists of:{
	=springs, axles, shock absorbers, rods, arms, and ball joints.#Most modern vehicles have independent suspension on the front wheels. An independent rear suspension (IRS), as the name implies, has the rear wheels independently sprung. A fully independent suspension has independent suspension on all wheels. Early independent systems used swing axles, but modern systems use Chapman or McPherson struts, trailing arms, multiple links, or wishbones.

::TQ0523::The basic types of springs used in a suspension system can include:{
	=coil spring, leaf spring, and torsion bar.#All suspension systems use springs to absorb impacts, the most common being: Coil spring, Leaf spring (also known as Hotchkiss, Cart, or semi-elliptical spring) and Torsion bar.

::TQ0529::Technician A says that independent rear suspension for a rear-wheel-drive vehicle is identical to independent suspension used in a front-wheel-drive vehicle.  Technician B says the axle shaft can be used as a suspension upper link. Who is correct?{
	~Technician A.#Technician B is correct. Independent rear suspension for a rear-wheel-drive vehicle is differs to independent suspension used in a front-wheel-drive vehicle as it has to accommodate the axle shafts.  The axle shaft can be used as a suspension upper link.
