	~Technician A.#Neither technician is correct as the ABS master cylinder is similar to the tandem master cylinder used in divided systems. It has a primary piston and a secondary piston.   The secondary piston incorporates a center valve. This controls the opening and closing of a supply port drilling in the piston. At rest, the supply port is open and connects the reservoir with the front brake circuits. The primary piston still has an inlet port and a compensating port.
