Technician B says the automotive brake system slows the car by converting its static energy into frictional heat and passing that heat to the surrounding air. Who is correct?{
	=Technician A.#Technician A is correct because when the brakes are applied they absorb the dynamic kinetic rotating energy from the drums/discs. The braking material heats up as energy transferred becomes frictional heat. The frictional heat (energy) is then transferred to the air.
