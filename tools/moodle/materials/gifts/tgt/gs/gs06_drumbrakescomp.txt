::TQ0695::One advantage of duo-servo brakes is that they:{
	=work well in both directions.#In a duo-servo drum brake system the self-energizing drum brake has servo action when traveling either forwards or backwards.
	~can be used with a booster.#In a duo-servo drum brake system the self-energizing drum brake has servo action when traveling either forwards or backwards.
	~wear faster.#In a duo-servo drum brake system the self-energizing drum brake has servo action when traveling either forwards or backwards.
	~resist brake dissolve.#In a duo-servo drum brake system the self-energizing drum brake has servo action when traveling either forwards or backwards.

::TQ0698::Compressed air must never be used to 'dust off' brake assemblies as the dust:{
	=can be dangerous to health.#Compressed air can circulate the contaminated brake dust into the environment. The technician can then breath the contaminated air which can be a health hazard.

::TQ0699::The composition of the friction material on drum brakes affects brake operation. Linings which provide good braking with low pedal pressures:{
	=tend to lose efficiency when they get hot.#Linings which maintain a stable friction co-efficient over a wide temperature range generally require higher pedal pressures to provide efficient braking, and may need the use of a booster.
	~tend to lose efficiency when they cool down.#Linings which maintain a stable friction co-efficient over a wide temperature range generally require higher pedal pressures to provide efficient braking, and may need the use of a booster.
	~tend to lose efficiency over time.#Linings which maintain a stable friction co-efficient over a wide temperature range generally require higher pedal pressures to provide efficient braking, and may need the use of a booster.
	~tend to gain efficiency when they get hot.#Linings which maintain a stable friction co-efficient over a wide temperature range generally require higher pedal pressures to provide efficient braking, and may need the use of a booster.
