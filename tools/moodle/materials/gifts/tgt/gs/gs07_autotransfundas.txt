::TQ0800::Fluid velocity is increased in a torque converter by:{
	=the shape of the turbine blades.#Fluid exits the impeller at high velocity and enters the turbine at its outer edge. This exerts a turning effort against the back of the turbine vanes which absorbs energy in the fluid, causing the turbine to rotate and transferring the drive to the transmission. The fluid, still at high velocity, now flows between the turbine vanes leaving the turbine in a direction opposite to impeller rotation.
