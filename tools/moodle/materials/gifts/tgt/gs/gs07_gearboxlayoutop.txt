::TQ0783::The function of the reverse idler in a transmission is to:{
	=change the direction of rotation of the mainshaft.#When reverse is selected the reverse idler connects with mating gears on the countershaft and main shaft. The reverse idler rotates on a plain shaft fixed in the casing. It transfers the drive from one shaft to the other and reverses the direction of rotation of the main shaft.
	~decrease the speed of the output shaft.#When reverse is selected the reverse idler connects with mating gears on the countershaft and main shaft. The reverse idler rotates on a plain shaft fixed in the casing. It transfers the drive from one shaft to the other and reverses the direction of rotation of the main shaft.

::TQ0787::Helical cut gears:{
	=reduce gear noise and distribute load evenly.#Helical gears offer a refinement over spur gears. The teeth are cut at an angle allowing for more gradual hence smoother meshing between gear wheels. This eliminates the whine characteristic of straight-cut gears.
