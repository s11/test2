::TQ1105::What does the rotating magnet in a very simple alternator induce in the stationary windings?{
	=An alternating current flow.#Alternating current cannot be used to charge a vehicle battery therefore the alternating current must be converted to direct current by the rectifier to charge the battery.
	~A variable current flow.#Alternating current cannot be used to charge a vehicle battery therefore the alternating current must be converted to direct current by the rectifier to charge the battery.
	~A constant current flow.#Alternating current cannot be used to charge a vehicle battery therefore the alternating current must be converted to direct current by the rectifier to charge the battery.
	~A direct current flow.#Alternating current cannot be used to charge a vehicle battery therefore the alternating current must be converted to direct current by the rectifier to charge the battery.
