::TQ0968::The current flow in a lead acid battery flows in one direction only. What is this called?{
	=Direct Current or DC.#In a lead acid battery, the electrical and chemical differences between the sets of plates creates a potential difference which makes the current flow in a circuit. It flows in one direction only so it is called direct current, or DC.
	~Alternating Current or AC.#In a lead acid battery, the electrical and chemical differences between the sets of plates creates a potential difference which makes the current flow in a circuit. It flows in one direction only so it is called direct current, or DC.
	~Positive Current or PC.#In a lead acid battery, the electrical and chemical differences between the sets of plates creates a potential difference which makes the current flow in a circuit. It flows in one direction only so it is called direct current, or DC.
	~Negative Current or NC.#In a lead acid battery, the electrical and chemical differences between the sets of plates creates a potential difference which makes the current flow in a circuit. It flows in one direction only so it is called direct current, or DC.

::TQ0970::What is an example of the heating effects of electricity?{
	=All of these.#As current flows through motor vehicle circuits, most of the electrical energy is transformed into other kinds of energy.
	~A headlight bulb.#As current flows through motor vehicle circuits, most of the electrical energy is transformed into other kinds of energy.
	~A rear window demister.#As current flows through motor vehicle circuits, most of the electrical energy is transformed into other kinds of energy.
	~Circuit protection from excessive current flow.#As current flows through motor vehicle circuits, most of the electrical energy is transformed into other kinds of energy.

::TQ0971::Electricity can have a magnetic effect.{
	=TRUE#Current passed through a coil of wire creates a magnetic field. Turning the current on and off can activate a mechanical relay, or create the rotary motion of an electric motor, such as a starter motor.
	~FALSE#Current passed through a coil of wire creates a magnetic field. Turning the current on and off can activate a mechanical relay, or create the rotary motion of an electric motor, such as a starter motor.
